  <blockquote>
<p><em>This post was originally written shortly after <em>Virtua Fighter 4 Final Tuned</em> had made its way onto Fightcade with rollback netcode. I was really interested in learning Sarah Bryant in that game, and while the resources certainly existed on <a href="https://virtuafighter.com">VFDC</a>, they were somewhat scattered and written in a very of-the-time style. I wrote this to be a kind of &ldquo;cleaned up&rdquo; and more central version of those resources, but when VFDC ended up adding VF4FT proper to its self-hosted wiki, I felt like keeping this up in public would have been stepping on some toes a little bit.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a compilation of information from a few different articles written by various Virtua Fighter players during the time of <em>Virtua Fighter 4 Final Tuned</em> (FT)’s arcade relevancy. I’ve reformatted a few things, corrected and in some cases added information, and updated notation to modern numerical standards for readability. Hopefully this will be useful for anyone looking to pick up Sarah in FT, now that the game is on Fightcade.</p>
<p>Be aware that this info was written primarily with reference to how things changed for Sarah going from <em>Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution</em> (Evo) to FT, so this won’t be an exhaustive guide to playing the character. It should be enough to get you started, however.</p>
<h2 id="master-guide---sarah-bryant">Master Guide - Sarah Bryant</h2>
<p>Source: <a href="https://virtuafighter.com/view.php?section=vf4&amp;chara=sarah&amp;file=vf4ft_sarah_master_guide.php">Virtua Fighter 4 Final Tuned Master Guide via Virtua Fighter Dot Com</a></p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In Evo, Sarah had a set of highly effective launchers, such as Dragon Smash Cannon (33K) and Serpent Smash Cannon (2P+KK). She was a character with easy combos and high damage, so long as you were good at confirming each hit. In FT, the properties of her moves remain largely unchanged, but her overall damage potential has been lowered. In return, however, she gained more options from her Flamingo Stance (FL), and many of her useful moves have been reworked in some key ways. Being able to control her new FL stance is the key to success with Sarah in FT.</p>
<h3 id="change-moves">Change Moves</h3>
<p><strong>A1 Crescent Heel (4K+G)</strong><br>
The animation and properties are unchanged from Evo, as you can still combo after it on hit. However, you can now press G to cancel the attack before the hit, which moves Sarah into FL stance.</p>
<p><strong>A2 Spin Edge Kick (4K+G)</strong><br>
This move is slow, but has notably long reach. Similarly to vanilla VF4, you can use this move to punish approaches from mid distances. While the move does have a fairly long recovery on guard, it can be very difficult to punish when properly spaced.</p>
<p><strong>B1 Spinning Scarecrow (K+G)</strong><br>
A full-circular high attack that transitions to FL. It’s +6 on hit, +11 on counter hit, and -3 on block. A good way to check evades and push offense.</p>
<p><strong>B2 Spin Kick (K+G)</strong><br>
A full-circular mid attack that knocks down on hit. Since the move is slow on startup (i25), it is best used for okizeme. It is -14 on block, but it can be useful to train your opponent to stand guard on wakeup, freeing up space to use lows or throws.
New Moves and Key Changes</p>
<p><strong>Combo Reverse High Kick (PPKK)</strong><br>
The third hit is a full-circular EX High, and the fourth hit is +3 on block. The last two hits are a natural combo even when delayed.</p>
<p><strong>Punch Knee Kick (P2K)</strong><br>
Standing punch followed by her Quick Knee (6K). The only difference it has from 6K is that P2K is -5 on block rather than -3.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Hook Kick (K_[6]K)</strong><br>
K now floats the opponent on counter hit, while [6]K will float on minor counter<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and above.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Smash Cannon (33K)</strong><br>
Now -14 on block, and had its range decreased, but the launch is mostly the same as in Evo.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Combination (3PK)</strong><br>
The second hit is now -1 on block (from +4 in Evo), but can now transition to Step stance with P+K+G.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow Hook Kick (6P4K)</strong><br>
High kick follow-up to 6P. This string is a natural combo so long as you don’t delay the second hit, and grants +3. Transitions to FL, and can also transition to Step with P+K+G.</p>
<p><strong>Valkyrie Sword (1K+GK)</strong><br>
The second hit is now -2 on block (down from +4 in Evo), but can transition to Step with P+K+G.</p>
<p><strong>Leg Slicer (2K+G)</strong><br>
Now requires a heavy counter hit<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to cause leg crumple.</p>
<p><strong>Spin Heel Sword (6K+G)</strong><br>
Has a different animation from the Evo version of the move, and is now 0 on block (up from -1 in Evo). No major differences otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Toe Kick (2P+K)</strong><br>
Now -10 on block (down from -6 in Evo).</p>
<p><strong>Turn Hook Kick (BT K+G)</strong><br>
Full circular high kick from back-turn that is +4 on hit and -2 on block. Transitions to FL, or to Step with P+K+G.</p>
<p><strong>Back Knuckle Side Kick (FL 6P+KK)</strong><br>
A high-mid series from FL, similar in application to P2K. Causes stagger on crouch hit.</p>
<p><strong>Edge Kick Combo Triple (FL 6P+K2K:K:K)</strong><br>
A low follow-up to FL 6P+K. The whole string is a natural combo, but each hit must be timed with the last for the move to be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Side Neck Cut Sword (FL 2_8P+K)</strong><br>
Can now be cancelled with G to return to FL.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse High Kick (FL K+GK)</strong><br>
Identical to the final two hits of PPKK. Ends back in FL at +3 on block, +4 on hit.</p>
<p><strong>Step (FL P+K+G)</strong><br>
A new stance available from FL, which grants access to new moves.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Straight Hook Kick (Step PK)</strong><br>
An i10 jab into EX High kick. The string is a natural combo.</p>
<p><strong>Toe Kick Combination (Step KKK)</strong><br>
A Mid-High-Mid kick string from Step. The first two hits are a natural combo, while the third hit causes a stomach crumple on counter hit. The first and third hits can be cancelled with G to transition into FL.</p>
<p><strong>Tornado Spin Kick (Step K+GK)</strong>
A High-EX High kick string. The first hit alone is very useful, as it grants +2 on block.</p>
<p><strong>Step Low Spin Kick (Step 2K+G)</strong><br>
A full-circular low sweep that knocks down on hit, and ends in FL.</p>
<p><strong>Step Low Kick Combo Triple (Step 2K:K:K)</strong><br>
Identical to the FL 6P+K2K:K:K sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Step Fake (Step P+K)</strong><br>
A low punch sabaki, identical to the low punch sabaki from FL. Ends in FL.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-with-new-and-changed-moves">Strategies With New And Changed Moves</h3>
<p>At a basic level, Sarah is able to form a strong nitaku using her new Punch Knee Kick (P2K) string alongside P into a throw.</p>
<p>Sarah is able to easily take the initiative with <strong>Combo Reverse High Kick (PPKK)</strong>. The third hit is a full-circular EX High, and on normal hit can be followed up with a basic mixup between <strong>6P</strong> and a throw. The fourth hit is +3 on block and moves into FL, giving you an opportunity to pressure. It’s a very convenient move that you should use until your opponent proves they can avoid it by crouching.<br>
Additionally, if the second hit counter hits, it will combo into the third hit. The third hit will always combo into the fourth hit. If the fourth hit counter hits, you can land a guaranteed <strong>Cut-in Chop~Setup Combination (FL 3PK)</strong> or <strong>Back Knuckle Side Kick (FL 6P+KK)</strong>.</p>
<p>Sarah’s main launching attack is <strong>Dragon Smash Cannon (33K)</strong>. It leads to strong combos, but is -14 on block. Since refloat combos from Evo are no longer possible, you should aim for combos involving <strong>High Kick Straight (KP)</strong> after landing this move.</p>
<p>The first hit of <strong>Serpent Smash Cannon (2P+KK)</strong> is now -10 on block, but combos after landing this move are much the same as in Evo.</p>
<h3 id="attack-options-from-fl">Attack Options From FL</h3>
<p>A strong option to use at frame advantage from FL is <strong>Reverse High Kick (FL K+GK)</strong>. It has all of the same properties as the final two hits of <strong>Combo Reverse High Kick</strong>, and here is also strong against sabaki attacks. Many attacks that transition into FL leave Sarah at +4 (such as <strong>Switch Kick (4K)</strong> and <strong>Double Rise Kick (4P+K)</strong> on block), which means that <strong>Reverse High Kick</strong>, which is i20, will beat any i12 standing punches from this advantage.</p>
<h2 id="regarding-change-moves">Regarding Change Moves</h2>
<p><strong>Crescent Heel (A1 4K+G)</strong> can G-cancel to FL, which will make it one of the main attacks in your offense.
<strong>Spin Edge Kick (A2 4K+G)</strong> is better suited to defensive play, as it can be used for keepout from medium ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Spinning Scarecrow (B1 K+G)</strong> is a strong way to check evades, as it hits high, is safe on block and grants +6 on hit with a transition into FL, giving you an opportunity for strong offense.<br>
<strong>Spin Kick (B2 K+G)</strong> is better if you want to focus on okizeme, as it slow startup makes it easiest to apply there. It’s -14 on block, but knocks down on hit with good damage, so it’s useful to train your opponent into stand blocking on wakeup.</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Smash Cannon provides a similar launch as it did in Evo, but it requires slightly different combos.</li>
<li>Crescent Heel is an important move, due to its ability to G-cancel into FL.</li>
<li>If you want to focus on okizeme, then Spin Kick is recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sarah’s basic combos from 33K are combo 4 in closed stance, and combo 5 in open stance.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> These combos will work on every character up to Kage’s weight class on normal hit, and up to Akira’s weight class on counter hit.<br>
On the lighter weight classes, combos 1, 2 and 3 will connect after a counter hit 33K.<br>
Combo 6 will work on Shun and Akira after a normal hit in open stance. The 1K+GK must be performed as quickly as possible on Akira, but it must be properly timed against other characters.<br>
Against heavyweights, combo 7 will work on both normal hit and counter hit. On a normal hit in closed stance, the P can be replaced with 4P and it will still work.</p>

</ol>
<p>Against lightweights, combo 8 will connect in closed stance, while combo 10 will connect in closed stance.<br>
For middleweights, use combo 12 in closed stance, and combo 13 in open stance.\</p>
<p>This starter provides a lot of character-specific combos as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combo 9 will work against Kage-Maru and Brad in closed stance, as well as against Wolf in either stance</li>
<li>Combo 11 will work against Goh in closed stance, and Shun-Di in open stance</li>
<li>Combo 12 will work against Jeffry in closed stance, while combo 14 will work against him in open stance</li>
</ul>
<p>Combos from 6PK (second hit CH) are much the same as combos from 2P+KK. Depending on other conditions (distance, if the opponent was crouching, etc), the height of the launch might vary, but otherwise, remember to take stance into account and try out these combos.</p>
<h3 id="spin-heel-sword-6kg">Spin Heel Sword (6K+G)</h3>
<ol start="16">
<li>1K+GK, FL 3PK</li>
<li>1K+GK, FL 8K</li>
</ol>
<p>A combo from an attack that smashes the opponent into the ground. Combo 17 is the basic combo that will work on most characters, but combo 16 will work against lightweights, so long as you are in closed stance after the move connects.</p>
<h3 id="double-rise-kick-4pk-crouch-hit">Double Rise Kick (4P+K) (crouch hit)</h3>
<ol start="18">

<li>FL P, 1K+GK</li>
<li>FL 6P+KK</li>
</ol>
<p>If the first hit of 4P+K hits crouching, the second hit will launch for a combo.
Against Aoi, Pai and Sarah, use combo 18 if in closed stance after the move connects, or combo 19 for open stance.<br>
For characters in weight classes from Vanessa to Kage-Maru, use combo 18.<br>
Against Lei-Fei, Shun-Di and Lion, only FL 1K will connect in closed stance, but in open stance, you can use combo 21 for Lei-Fei, combo 20 for Shun-Di and combo 22 for Lion.<br>
For Lau and Jeffry, combo 18 will connect in closed stance. Combo 22 will connect in open stance, but you must use 11K+GK.<br>
Against, Jacky, Akira and Wolf, use combo 23 in closed stance, and combo 21 in open stance.</p>
<h3 id="leg-slicer-2kg-heavy-ch">Leg Slicer (2K+G) (heavy CH)</h3>

</ol>
<p>When Leg Slicer causes a leg crumple, combo 24 will connect on every character except for the heavyweights in closed stance, while 25 will connect in open stance against the same group of characters.
Combo 26 will work against the heavyweights.<br>
If you want to focus on ukemizeme<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, go for combo 27.</p>
<h3 id="high-kick-straight-6kp-minor-counter-and-above">High Kick Straight ([6]KP) (minor counter and above)</h3>
<ol start="27">
<li>336K+GK</li>

<li>2KK</li>
</ol>
<p>When High Kick Straight lands as a minor counter, combo 30 will connect if in closed stance after the move connects, while combo 29 will connect in open stance.<br>
Combo 28 will work in most cases if the move lands as a true counter hit, but in this situation, only combo 29 is reliable against heavyweights in closed stance.</p>
<h3 id="cut-in-middle-fl-3k-counter-hit-or-toe-kick-combination-step-kkk-third-hit-ch">Cut-In Middle (FL 3K) (counter hit) or Toe Kick Combination (Step KKK) (third hit CH)</h3>

<li>FL G, 1K+GK, FL PK</li>
<li>FL P, [6]P, 2KK</li>
<li>FL P, 2KK</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, the same combos are possible from both leg crumple (i.e. CH 2K+G) and stomach crumple.
Combo 31 will work on lightweights after a stomach crumple.<br>
For combos 32-34, divide them by weight class – combo 32 for lightweights, combo 33 for middleweights, and combo 34 for heavyweights. Be careful, though – although she’s a lightweight, only combo 35 will connect on Pai during open stance.<br>
Note that combos 35 and 36 do not involve G-canceling Flamingo stance.<br>
Combo 36 will work on heavyweights, while, combo 25 should work on everyone else.</p>
