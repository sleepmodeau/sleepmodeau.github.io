  <blockquote>
<p><em>This one&rsquo;s easy. The piece on</em> Goddess of Victory: NIKKE <em>is here because, to be quite frank, I didn&rsquo;t give the game its due diligence. Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that I actually think the game is good or anything - far from it. As I point out in the article itself, I&rsquo;m not the target audience for these kinds of games&hellip; and that&rsquo;s kind of the problem. I wasn&rsquo;t really willing to properly engage with the game and its systems, and so I didn&rsquo;t spend much time bothering to actually learn how the game worked when I played it, and that combined with a few people in my circles comparing it to popular rail shooters just didn&rsquo;t leave me well-equipped to assess the game with much in the way of intellectual honesty or factual accuracy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I don’t normally do the whole mobile game thing. They’re usually massive time sinks and even larger money sinks, almost always without any actual engaging gameplay to back them up. This was set to change when I found out about a recently released mobile game called <em>Goddess of Victory: NIKKE</em>, a – <a href="https://sleepmodeblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/my-thoughts-on-power-rangers-legacy-wars/">fucking god damn it</a> <a href="https://sleepmodeblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/my-thoughts-on-power-rangers-legacy-wars/">not again</a></p>
<p>When seeing people talk about <em>NIKKE</em>, it would be centered on one of two ideas. They would either say “oh, that mobage<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that plays like a rail shooter”, or they would say “oh, you mean the ass game.”</p>
<p><img src="/img/nikke_game1.jpg" alt="This is an actual in-game screenshot."></p>
<p>And look, as much as Rapi’s thang do be thangin’ in that screenshot there, the whole “ass game” thing doesn’t mean much to me<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But the comparison to rail shooters did pique my interest. After all, that particular genre of game is one of my favourite in all of video games, and I thought that maybe a mobage that plays similarly to it would make for something interesting, perhaps even a little engaging.</p>
<p>If I had remembered that “mobage” was a prominent part of that thought, then I probably would have realised how incorrect that assessment would end up being.</p>
<p>I didn’t make it very far through the early parts of this game because it is exactly the same as every other mobage full of stripped-down JRPG interfaces and entirely too much tutorial text. The goal of the game, then, is not to play the game, but to pull on the slots for a new JPEG of a girl that you can spend entirely too much time and/or money on upgrading to a point of vague usefulness for, I dunno, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/comments/yqozqz/top_gw_player_had_to_be_hospitalized/">some shit that might put you in hospital?</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The core “gameplay” of <em>NIKKE</em> is basically just pretending to be a cover shooter. Your squad of five girls hides behind cover automatically whenever you enter a combat encounter, and by tapping and holding on the screen, your currently selected girl will get out from behind cover and start shooting at the on-screen reticle, which you drag around the screen to hit enemies. This is where the rail shooter comparisons come from – it’s the broad strokes of the <em>Time Crisis</em> formula.</p>
<p>There are two primary ways <em>NIKKE</em> spices up its gameplay with its own mechanics, and both have to do with its team composition elements. Each girl has a different weapon type, as well as a “Burst Skill” at one of three levels (1, 2 or 3). The weapon types create some space for picking different weapons based on enemy proximity and formation, while the Burst Skills are basically your team super, with the idea being that your team should have at least one Burst Skill of each level so you can chain through all of them and activate “Full Burst”, which grants your entire team a temporary damage buff. The tactical possibility space provided by these mechanics isn’t very wide, though, because… well, of course it isn’t.</p>
<p>The gameplay being comparable to rail shooters doesn’t last very long, either. While the basic concept is there, the problem with <em>NIKKE</em> is that it offers none of the interesting gameplay challenges or considerations that the rail shooter genre builds itself on – because of course it doesn’t. Enemies signal their impending gunfire with a visual indicator, like in <em>Virtua Cop</em>, but they also attack in hordes like <em>The House of the Dead</em>. This means that even though enemy fire is being telegraphed, there’s a constant barrage of it that eliminates any potential for the strategic enemy clearing that is so prevalent in actual rail shooters. Naturally, this also removes all of the twitchy, high-tension moments of dodging critical enemy fire at the last second which you’d find in <em>Time Crisis</em>, because you are supposed to account for having to sponge some damage, even if you’re taking cover – because taking cover only <em>partially</em> blocks damage to your squad. You do, of course, have the option of forcing your entire squad to hunker down, but this is only really relevant in boss battles, where the bosses themselves are built like the bosses from <em>The House of the Dead</em>, with individual body parts that can be attacked, as well as telegraphed high-power attacks with signals for where they’re coming from – but no means of interrupting them.</p>
<p>The sum total of all these design decisions is that the core gameplay of <em>NIKKE</em> isn’t so much a rail shooter as it is yet another barebones JRPG focused entirely on DPS checks, but poorly disguised as a rail shooter. Because the point isn’t to play a fun and engaging shoot-em-up on your mobile phone, it’s to con some vulnerable people into the skinner box so they can spend money to develop parasocial relationships with cartoon characters.
The game seems to think really highly of its characters, too, what with all the ways you can interact with them in-game<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. I suppose I have to admire the confidence there, considering that they’re all lowest-common-denominator military waifus whose designs are all simultaneously outrageously self-indulgent and painfully uninspired. The self-indulgent designs are brought to the fore by a weird Live2D-esque animation style, which seems more than comfortable situating itself in the deepest trench of the uncanny valley, animating as awkwardly as possible because at least that way the boobs and buttcheeks jiggle <em>juuuuust</em> right – the creators of the game, Shift Up and Level Infinite, probably imagine this to be the only reason anyone will want to play the game. They’re probably right.</p>
<p>Look, I’m not the audience for these games. I’m probably a mobile game publisher’s worst nightmare – I can’t fall for any of the game’s tricks to get money out of me, and I can’t ever stick to these games, not even the ones that I like. This was probably a lost cause for me from the get-go, but when I heard all the comparisons between <em>NIKKE</em> and Time Crisis, I couldn’t help but want to find out what the deal was. Maybe a comparison to Time Crisis is earned, as long as you specify <em>Time Crisis 5</em> – because like that game, <em>NIKKE</em> fucking sucks.</p>
