      <description>A short while ago I wrote a first impressions piece on the recently-released mobile game Goddess of Victory: NIKKE, where I blasted it for largely being &amp;ldquo;just another JRPG focused on DPS checks&amp;rdquo; rather than actually taking advantage of its core mechanical premise of being a Time Crisis-esque cover shooter.
