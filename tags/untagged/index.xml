      <description>So, uh. I guess 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly 2021 Hard Mode, but we can&amp;rsquo;t exactly say there were many&amp;hellip; systemic improvements to the stuff that was fucked about last year, either. I&amp;rsquo;m at least doing okay on a personal level, which means I&amp;rsquo;m in a better position to be working with others to fight for those systemic improvements at least!
Anyway, this is gonna go on mostly the same beat as the last one of these, though it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be focused exclusively on games.</description>

      <description>A short while ago I wrote a first impressions piece on the recently-released mobile game Goddess of Victory: NIKKE, where I blasted it for largely being &amp;ldquo;just another JRPG focused on DPS checks&amp;rdquo; rather than actually taking advantage of its core mechanical premise of being a Time Crisis-esque cover shooter. This involved a rundown of some of the game&amp;rsquo;s core mechanics that was, to put it mildly, extremely fucking wrong.</description>

      <title>Melee Is Sick, and I Don&#39;t Want to Play It</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older, more mature and more experienced with the fighting game genre, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to become pretty good at honestly assessing my feelings about particular games. This honesty really reached a strong point of development when I finally realised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like BlazBlue Central Fiction all that much (you can read about that in my article &amp;ldquo;Learning to Love, to Learn and to Let Go&amp;rdquo;), and it&amp;rsquo;s come to carry forward into another game which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fraught relationship with &amp;ndash; Super Smash Bros.</description>
