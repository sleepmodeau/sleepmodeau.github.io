      <description>You guys don&amp;rsquo;t fucking know how to talk about anything. I mean, I know that Twitter as a format is basically anathema to actual discussion but you could at least try.&#xA;The Twitter account FightstickArt, ostensibly an account centered on showing off people&amp;rsquo;s cool fight sticks and artwork and stuff, took part in the time-honoured tradition of engagement farming by posing a question to FGC twitter: what&amp;rsquo;s most important to you in a fighting game?</description>

      <title>Melee Is Sick, and I Don&#39;t Want to Play It</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older, more mature and more experienced with the fighting game genre, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to become pretty good at honestly assessing my feelings about particular games. This honesty really reached a strong point of development when I finally realised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like BlazBlue Central Fiction all that much (you can read about that in my article &amp;ldquo;Learning to Love, to Learn and to Let Go&amp;rdquo;), and it&amp;rsquo;s come to carry forward into another game which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fraught relationship with &amp;ndash; Super Smash Bros.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve missed every discourse cycle for the past few months and god damn it I will not miss this one when there is #content to be created.&#xA;Anyway, here are my scattered thoughts on some of the bigger announcements that were made at the 2022 edition of Evo, everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite fighting game trade show masquerading as a tournament.1&#xA;Capcom Capcom revealed two new characters for the upcoming Street Fighter 6 &amp;ndash; Juri Han and Kimberly.</description>

      <title>The Spectator&#39;s Guide to Bloody Roar Extreme</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again: Combo Breaker is almost upon us. Of the many FGC majors sprinkled throughout the US, the Chicago, IL event is most notable for its emphasis on spotlighting novel, commuinty-driven brackets &amp;ndash; most notorious are its Mystery Game and Auction tournaments, including the cultural touchstone that was the Sarvets All-Stars tournament from 2018. And while these kinds of events are almost certainly appearing at Combo Breaker 2022, the main stage will also be seeing a new challenger among the likes of Guilty Gear Strive and The King of Fighters XV &amp;ndash; a Nintendo Gamecube game called Bloody Roar Extreme.</description>

      <title>KOF XV Balance Change Proposals</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.neocities.org/posts/kofxv-change-wishlist/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing The King of Fighters XV a lot lately. I think the game is very good, and overall the balance is pretty spot-on, but there are a few things that I think warrant some changes &amp;ndash; nothing drastic, just a few quality of life changes here and there. I&amp;rsquo;m putting them all here so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to see them all over your timeline. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to justify every proposal I&amp;rsquo;m making here.</description>

      <description>Prior to Guilty Gear Strive and Dragon Ball FighterZ, Arc System Works&amp;rsquo; three most prolific and popular fighting games were Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2 and BlazBlue Centralfiction. These are all games I&amp;rsquo;ve spent varying &amp;ndash; but generally large &amp;ndash; amounts of time with, and my opinions of them have varied accordingly. My rocky relationship with all three of these games is well-documented, here and elsewhere, but I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a pretty clear idea of how I feel about all these games.</description>

      <title>My New Year&#39;s Resolution</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.neocities.org/posts/new-years-resolution/</link>

      <description>In my last piece, I may have said a few things about my feelings on Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R and BlazBlue Central Fiction. Those feelings may have been largely negative feelings where I admitted my frustrations and losses came from a lack of knowledge, but then I rationalised my lack of desire to play these games as simply not wanting to fill those gaps in my knowledge.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like I was scrubquoting hard in doing so.</description>

      <title>New Players Are Not Stupid Pt.2</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.neocities.org/posts/new-players-are-not-stupid-2/</link>

      <description>I think, fundamentally, engaging with any video game (but especially a fighting game) is akin to a conversation between developer and player.&#xA;As a developer, your goal should be to confidently communicate your game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics to your player, and trust that the player will be able to keep up. There&amp;rsquo;s a delicate balance here, though &amp;ndash; say too little, and your player won&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable contributing to the conversation on their own.</description>
