      <description>So, uh. I guess 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly 2021 Hard Mode, but we can&amp;rsquo;t exactly say there were many&amp;hellip; systemic improvements to the stuff that was fucked about last year, either. I&amp;rsquo;m at least doing okay on a personal level, which means I&amp;rsquo;m in a better position to be working with others to fight for those systemic improvements at least!
Anyway, this is gonna go on mostly the same beat as the last one of these, though it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be focused exclusively on games.</description>

      <description>So 2021 happened. I was originally going to introduce this piece with a brief overview of the political situation under COVID-19 as a way to contrast how awful the year was with some personal levity, but the idea of jumping from &amp;ldquo;the far right is growing out of an anti-vaccine movement while governments continue to glibly allow their citizens to die from a preventable disease and ordinary people try pick up the slack where their leaders and fascist/fascist-adjacent neighbours have failed&amp;rdquo; to talking about the video games I played this past year felt like a bit too strong of a tonal whiplash.</description>
