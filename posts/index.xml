			<description>So 2021 happened. I was originally going to introduce this piece with a brief overview of the political situation under COVID-19 as a way to contrast how awful the year was with some personal levity, but the idea of jumping from &amp;ldquo;the far right is growing out of an anti-vaccine movement while governments continue to glibly allow their citizens to die from a preventable disease and ordinary people try pick up the slack where their leaders and fascist/fascist-adjacent neighbours have failed&amp;rdquo; to talking about the video games I played this past year felt like a bit too strong of a tonal whiplash.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So 2021 happened. I was originally going to introduce this piece with a brief overview of the political situation under COVID-19 as a way to contrast how awful the year was with some personal levity, but the idea of jumping from &ldquo;the far right is growing out of an anti-vaccine movement while governments continue to glibly allow their citizens to die from a preventable disease and ordinary people try pick up the slack where their leaders and fascist/fascist-adjacent neighbours have failed&rdquo; to talking about the video games I played this past year felt like a bit too strong of a tonal whiplash. This preamble has done nothing to avoid that whiplash, but at least I tried.</p>
<p>Anyway, I played some video games in 2021. Let&rsquo;s talk about them.</p>
<h3 id="guilty-gear-strive-i-guess">GUILTY GEAR STRIVE, I GUESS</h3>
<p><a href="https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/new-players-are-not-stupid-2/">I&rsquo;ve said my piece on this game.</a> I won&rsquo;t repeat myself too much here, but suffice to say &ndash; I do not like this game. It replaced everything I liked about <em>Guilty Gear</em> with subtly (or sometimes overtly) worse versions of those things, and made the things I didn&rsquo;t like about <em>Guilty Gear</em> even worse &ndash; when it wasn&rsquo;t replacing them with something that exchanged my frustration for boredom, anyway. But hey, the people playing it are enjoying themselves, so you don&rsquo;t have to listen to me. I&rsquo;m not really the target audience for this game, and shockingly, probably not any <em>Guilty Gear</em> game.</p>
<h3 id="acpr-got-rollback-and-now-i-hate-it">ACPR GOT ROLLBACK AND NOW I HATE IT</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying that gets brought up every now and then in the fighting game community &ndash; &ldquo;picking a fighting game is about picking what bullshit you&rsquo;re willing to deal with&rdquo;. Over time, I&rsquo;ve found that sentiment to be less and less convincing. Learning and improving at a fighting game will inevitably be frustrating sometimes, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a sign of healthy engagement when you simply learn to &ldquo;deal&rdquo; with the things that frustrate you &ndash; there should, I think, be some amount of motivation to learn how to get past these challenging, frustrating elements based on curiosity and intrigue, instead of just an obligation to do so because you&rsquo;re gonna have to figure it out at some point anyway.</p>
<p>When <em>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R</em> got its miraculous rollback netcode update (with continuous QOL improvements up until the end of 2021), I very soon learned that the frustrating part of that game, for me, was the Australian Regional Meta. In places like Japan and the US, playing <em>ACPR</em> will get you a decent amount of character variety and a broad assortment of skill levels and playstyles. In Australia, you get an environment dominated by Justice, Order-Sol and A.B.A. doing Their One Thing over and over until they win, refusing to ever move past layer one. Every loss feels shameful, and every victory feels pyrrhic. Of course, I&rsquo;m well past trying to blame my losses on anyone but myself, and while the knowledge that I could learn how to overcome these frustrations lingers in the back of my mind, a question remains: do I want to? And the answer is always a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I dunno, maybe I&rsquo;ve just hit my &ldquo;fighting game oyaji&rdquo; phase a decade early, but these days I just don&rsquo;t have the time or the energy to try and motivate myself to learn what&rsquo;s required of me when what I&rsquo;d have to learn seems far more annoying than compelling. I don&rsquo;t want to pick the bullshit I want to deal with &ndash; I want to pick the bullshit that I like.</p>
<h3 id="flycast-got-rollback-and-now-i-am-living-my-best-life">FLYCAST GOT ROLLBACK AND NOW I AM LIVING MY BEST LIFE</h3>
<p>When I found out that developer &ldquo;flyinghead&rdquo; had somehow implemented GGPO netplay into their Sega Dreamcast emulator <em>Flycast</em>, it was through me waking up to about five different people telling me about it on social media. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it then, and I can&rsquo;t believe it now, even though I&rsquo;ve spent more time playing <em>Project Justice</em>, <em>Virtua Fighter 3tb</em> and <em>SoulCalibur</em> with people from all across Australia and the world than I ever expected to. Hell, I spent even more time than that playing <em>Capcom vs SNK 2</em>, so maybe I really have hit my &ldquo;fighting game oyaji&rdquo; phase. Games from this particular era, on this particular set of hardware &ndash; Dreamcast, NAOMI and Atomiswave &ndash; are probably among my favourite in the genre, and despite how easily I get distracted, I always find myself coming back to them eventually. These games are just magical for me &ndash; they&rsquo;re always fun, and anything that&rsquo;s frustrating is often equally funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely only a matter of time before I become the <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> player I was always meant to be. In the meantime, see me in <em>SoulCalibur</em> or <em>The King of Fighters XI</em>.</p>
<h3 id="i-tried-slippi-one-last-time-and-melee-finally-made-sense-to-me">I TRIED SLIPPI ONE LAST TIME AND MELEE FINALLY MADE SENSE TO ME</h3>
<p>The first time I tried getting into <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, back when Slippi first released its rollback netplay functionality for the game, the experience nearly made me quit fighting games. Having the army of netplay Falcos dance all over my flailing body while I could barely get the game to do anything I wanted it to do showed me a unique kind of helplessness that no amount of looping unblockable setplay could ever make me feel.<br>
The second time I simply resolved that the game is cool, but not for me. Far too much effort involved in learning how to properly manipulate my character to make it worthwhile.<br>
The third time, I finally got it. I still don&rsquo;t actively play the game, mostly for the same reason as the second go around, but now it&rsquo;s a game that <em>could</em> be for me &ndash; a younger me with more free time and brain cells to rub together. As the saying goes &ndash; <em>Melee</em> is sick.</p>
<p>&hellip;wait, what do you mean <a href="https://twitter.com/FaultyPine/status/1467605279244271621?s=20">someone&rsquo;s starting to get rollback working in <em>Brawl</em>?</a></p>
<h3 id="i-finally-installed-outrun-2-fxt-and-i-am-vibing-to-magical-sound-shower-right-now">I FINALLY INSTALLED OUTRUN 2 FXT AND I AM VIBING TO MAGICAL SOUND SHOWER RIGHT NOW</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much more to add to this. Control settings are finicky because it&rsquo;s a port of an Xbox game from 2006, but the <a href="http://dragonking.arcadecontrols.com/static.php?page=AboutFXT">&ldquo;OutRun 2 FXT&rdquo; mod</a> for Sega&rsquo;s masterpiece, <em>OutRun 2</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> adds a lot of compatibility options for modern displays and operating systems. I&rsquo;m gonna have to get a racing wheel for this at some point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s this section. <em>OutRun 2</em> is one of the greatest video games ever made. It&rsquo;s also technically abandonware, so you have no excuse not to <a href="https://archive.org/details/OUTRUN2006C2C">download it</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and play it right now.</p>
<h3 id="i-played-a-bunch-of-shmups-and-have-not-become-competent-at-any-of-them">I PLAYED A BUNCH OF SHMUPS AND HAVE NOT BECOME COMPETENT AT ANY OF THEM</h3>
<p>My good friend <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Pichy_And_Pals">Pichy</a> bought me a copy of <em>Deathsmiles</em> a couple years ago, and this genre has been stuck in my peripheral vision ever since then. I have not completed a playthrough of the game more than once, and in the preceding years I bought myself <em>Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION</em> and <em>ZeroRanger</em>. I have not completed either.</p>
<p><em>Crimzon Clover</em> is a game I have very little to say about, but only because I&rsquo;ve played so little of it. It feels great and the game showering you with item pickups and massive score multiplier displays helps create a lot of the Happy Brain Chemical. I may very well get sucked into it more if I boot it up on a whim again, but I&rsquo;m also on a search for the one shmup that just hooks me. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p><em>ZeroRanger</em>, on the other hand, is a game that I found pretty frustrating in the beginning &ndash; its colour palette made a lot of enemy ships and their bullets weirdly difficult for me to keep track of. And yet, at no point does the game&rsquo;s challenge feel unfair, at least once I got past that first hurdle. I&rsquo;m still somewhere in the second loop, and while I haven&rsquo;t gone back to it in a while, I definitely understand why people recommended it to me. It manages to be very forgiving with its stage unlocks and continue system, while also desigining those systems in a way that makes them feel almost a bit unforgiving. I don&rsquo;t know if this is a game I&rsquo;d actually want to learn seriously, but it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<h3 id="my-arcade-got-taiko-no-tatsujin-and-i-am-this-close-to-getting-my-own-bachi">MY ARCADE GOT TAIKO NO TATSUJIN AND I AM THIS CLOSE TO GETTING MY OWN BACHI</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty fortunate to have a fairly active community of rhythm game players that like to head to the arcade at a pretty central shopping destination near my house. We all initially coalesced around <em>Dance Rush Stardom</em>, a BEMANI game where the entire gimmick is that you are quite literally using Melbourne Shuffle dance techniques to play it, but the growing presence of dedicated players alongside the general broad appeal that music games have to passers-by has led to a slight expansion of available rhythm games. It started with <em>Dance Dance Revolution A</em> (and later <em>A20</em>), then an old <em>DrumMania</em> cabinet, and soon after we were bombarded with <em>Maimai DX</em>, <em>Pump It Up</em> and a guitar-side <em>Gitadora</em> cabinet. The latest addition to that collection is Bandai Namco&rsquo;s <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em>, and it might be my new favourite rhythm game?</p>
<p>One of the strengths of rhythm games as a genre is that they&rsquo;re usually pretty easy to learn, but nigh impossible to truly master. The curve doesn&rsquo;t look the same between all games, however &ndash; a game like <em>Beatmania IIDX</em> has a pretty high skill floor and only gets more intense from there, while a game like <em>Guitar Hero</em> is pretty easy to pick up thanks to a simple control scheme and lack of variable timing windows, but caps out the skill ceiling at a strange level where most of the difficulty comes from figuring out how to most efficiently hit the increasingly dense note patterns that crop up as the game&rsquo;s high-level meta continues to progress. <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em> feels like it&rsquo;s probably got the most balanced learning curve of just about any rhythm game I&rsquo;ve played this side of <em>DDR</em>. With only two ways to hit the drum, the game gets you hooked by establishing a solid base that allows you to feel like you&rsquo;re pretty damn good at the game &ndash; the road to improvement, then, comes from learning how to properly parse the beatmap and knowing the best way to guide your hands around the drum. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time that an instrument-based rhythm game has been more demanding than actually playing the real instrument, but that just adds to the lasting appeal.</p>
<h3 id="deltarune-chapter-2-came-out-so-i-played-through-the-whole-thing-again">DELTARUNE CHAPTER 2 CAME OUT SO I PLAYED THROUGH THE WHOLE THING AGAIN</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty cool seeing Toby Fox grow and evolve as an artist. <em>Undertale</em> is as famous as it is for a reason, and while it stuck with me much as it did everyone else, it&rsquo;s not necessarily for the same reasons. I&rsquo;ve always been more interested by the themes present in these games rather than their explicit lore or narrative, and while it was a bit hamfisted in some respects, it was pretty interesting seeing the things that <em>Undertale</em> had to say about the way people engage with violence in video games. Not like the hamfistedness is a bad thing &ndash; Yoko Taro has basically made a career out of it, and Fox&rsquo;s first non-ROM hack effort tackles the subject with a lot more tact than Taro, in many regards. So when Fox released the second chapter in his new episodic work, <em>Deltarune</em>, I felt it pertinent to go through the first chapter again, if only because the last time I had played it was when it came out in 2018.</p>
<p>These games are charming like nothing else, and the entire <em>Deltarune</em> dev team has done a lot to improve and build on much of the core experience of <em>Undertale</em> while also leveraging new ideas and mechanics to make the game more compelling and fun as a game as well as a narrative and general thought exercise. Thematically, <em>Deltarune</em> seems to be very concerned with the idea of agency &ndash; when the player controls a character in a game world, are they the character, or the player? Are they both? Where does one end and the other begin? Who is the one making the decisions, and whose decisions are the ones that actually matter? This exploration of the relationship between player and player character is one that&rsquo;s pretty novel, at least to me, and I was pretty impressed by the ways in which the two available chapters explore that question in different ways.</p>
<p>The writing is also fantastic in other areas, of course. The game&rsquo;s irreverent, slightly bewildering sense of humour is not only intact from <em>Undertale</em>, but also much improved in quality, in a way that really understands what the Extremely Online people who play these games find funny &ndash; which, of course, includes cartoon splat noises and stock explosion effects that have been bundled with <em>Game Maker</em> since version 6. Special mention has to be given to Queen specifically in chapter 2 &ndash; that character is a fucking riot.</p>
<p>Both chapters are free if you haven&rsquo;t played them already. I highly suggest you do. Now stop talking about Gaster.</p>
<h3 id="bbcf-got-rollback-and-now-i-hate-it">BBCF GOT ROLLBACK AND NOW I HATE IT</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying that gets brought up every now and then in the fighting game community &ndash; &ldquo;picking a fighting game is about picking what bullshit you&rsquo;re willing to deal with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I thought <em>BlazBlue Central Fiction</em> was &ldquo;the bullshit I was willing to deal with&rdquo;. After all, alongside the usual suspects that were <em>Street Fighter IV</em> and <em>Tekken 6</em>, one of the first fighting games I tried to seriously learn as a competitor was <em>BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend</em>. I&rsquo;ve been with this series for a long time, and after finding a character I grew to love in <em>Chronophantasma Extend</em>&rsquo;s Kagura Mutsuki, I thought I&rsquo;d be with it for a good while longer now that the game has functional online play.</p>
<p>This is not the case. I cannot handle this game &ndash; not any more, anyway. I earnestly tried to learn about and understand each of the game&rsquo;s characters, who are all designed like dense and inscrutable puzzle boxes, but when those characters aren&rsquo;t filling the screen with nonsense and hitting me with moves that are overheads despite not looking meaningfully distinct from anything else they could be doing, they&rsquo;re turning every hit into a 15-second combo whose knockdown creates a safejump that also invalidates most of the game&rsquo;s unwieldy wakeup options.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the energy or the patience for this shit any more. Part of me wonders if <em>BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle</em> will be a more positive experience for me, if only because the game respects my time enough to just fucking kill me if I get hit, but somehow, I doubt it.</p>
<h3 id="kusoge-advent-calendar-2021">KUSOGE ADVENT CALENDAR 2021</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already know, I&rsquo;m part of the so-called &ldquo;committee&rdquo; of people who decide on games to be featured on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQhAcigABBw&amp;list=PLmq6bEN5THET4hmFmZDIQwliJDDOdiOSu">Kusoge Advent Calendar</a>, a yearly marathon hosted on my friend AJ&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tyronesama">Twitch channel</a> where they play approximately one bad/weird/occasionally good fighting game every day from the start of December until Christmas. I invite you to go through the playlist and see what happens, but some standouts from this year were:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Garouden Breakblow: Fist or Twist</em>, which is not so much a &ldquo;fighting game&rdquo; as much as it is a &ldquo;game about fighting&rdquo;. Each of the game&rsquo;s hits feel weighty and impactful, and the way the camera zooms in during the early phases of a match where both players trade blows in a weird kind of damage race only sells the impact of those hits even more. Coupled with the game&rsquo;s unique tug-of-war life bar and bodily damage systems, <em>Garouden Breakblow</em> delivers a keen sense of drama that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen in any other fighting game, or that many games, full stop. It&rsquo;s an absolute blast to play with friends, too &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve got a PS2 (or a laptop), you should definitely take this to a local.</li>
<li><em>WeaponLord</em>, but only because playing it ended up being more of a historical discussion about the mindset of Western fighting game developers in the 90s, as well as a deep dive into &ldquo;XBAND&rdquo;, a service that allowed SNES and Sega Mega Drive owners to play games with others online, over a <em>dial-up internet connection</em>. Of particular note is that <em>WeaponLord</em> was the only XBAND-compatible game which advertised said compatibility on the box because it was built for XBAND from the ground-up &ndash; this is important because for every other game that was played over XBAND, the creators of the service had to <em>reverse-engineer those games in order to get the damn thing to work</em>. We talked about that instead of playing <em>WeaponLord</em>, because <em>WeaponLord</em> is not a very good game.</li>
<li><em>Vs.</em>, a game whose reputation as &ldquo;the weird localisation of <em>Fighter&rsquo;s Impact</em>&rdquo; absolutely does not do it justice. This game is absolutely wild, with insane guard break mechanics and some questionable moves that take advantage of those mechanics, but it&rsquo;s a standout among 3D fighting games on the PSX solely for the fact that it actually controls well and runs at a good framerate &ndash; something usually only achieved by Namco&rsquo;s offerings of the time.</li>
<li><em>Spectral Vs. Generation</em>, a game which stands as a testament to just how much Taiwanese developer IGS was able to learn about making fighting games in its roughly ten years of doing so.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> While it&rsquo;s not without busted and highly exploitable jank, the game has a baseline good feel with some grime to get into even without jumping into the various infinites it allows, and the characters all feel fairly strong and functional. It&rsquo;s a good time, and it&rsquo;s on Fightcade!</li>
<li><em>The Untouchable</em>, because&hellip; look, just watch the VOD. I promise you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are always a great time, and I&rsquo;m always thankful for everyone else on the committee for being so courteous in the face of me inevitably screwing around their schedule because of the fake-ass timezone I live in. See you in December.</p>
<h3 id="the-king-of-fighters-xv-x-dnf-duel-a-tale-of-two-betas">THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV X DNF DUEL: A TALE OF TWO BETAS</h3>
<p>These two games are what gives me hope for the genre outside of Fightcade. <em>KOFXV</em> had a beta before the one it held in December &ndash; concurrently with <em>DNF Duel</em> &ndash; but I&rsquo;ll just lump the experience of both betas in together.</p>
<p><em>KOFXV</em> is basically what I expected it to be &ndash; a sequel to <em>KOFXIV</em>, which naturally means that it is really good. I had faith in SNK to create a satisfactory game to begin with, because they haven&rsquo;t felt the need to drastically shake up what <em>KOF</em> fundamentally is<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and building on the systems and design philosophy of <em>KOFXIV</em> moving into the new entry was a great decision. Game felt good, online play was flawless (at least in the second beta, where it counts), and I&rsquo;m excited to spend more time with it when it releases.</p>
<p>Now, <em>DNF Duel</em>. This was originally going to get its own whole write-up, but I&rsquo;ve done enough screaming about it anyway so I&rsquo;ll just commit a section here to it instead.<br>
8ing, developers of all sorts of wacky and fun fighting games from the <em>Naruto: Clash of Ninja</em> series to <em>Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3</em>, are nothing short of legends in the FGC &ndash; known for just running with their ideas and throwing consequence to the wind, they could always be relied on to provide a game that was just good old-fashioned Fighting Game Absurdity when other games failed to meet expectations. But when we needed them most, they vanished &ndash; their last proper fighting game effort in a long while being <em>Steel Combat</em>, a 2016 release made exclusively for Oculus VR systems after they were bought by Colopl. But when Neople, developers of old-as-time action MMORPG <em>Dungeon Fighter Online</em>, announced that they were collaborating with Arc System works to create a fighting game based on their online game, one detail was pretty inconspicuously popped in at the end of the trailer.<br>
8ing was back. And boy, are they back.</p>
<p>8ing has always had a few common threads between all of their fighting games &ndash; simple but flexible controls, massive hitboxes and wacky non-standard resource management.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> All of the above is here in full force, and it&rsquo;s hard not to feel like this is a return to form for 8ing. ArcSys&rsquo;s production helps reign in some of 8ing&rsquo;s artistic excesses<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> while also helping the game to look gorgeous and play exceptionally well online thanks to its rollback netcode. Each character feels powerful in unique and idiotic ways, from Berserker&rsquo;s stationary Gore Cross projectile backing up his &ldquo;my footsies nice&rdquo; normal attacks, to Striker&rsquo;s divekick that reverse beats into seven overheads, to Crusader&rsquo;s righteous hammer comboing into itself like five times in the corner he just made for himself. This game is beautiful and hilarious in a way I thought the industry had left behind, and the game I played is basically the game I want &ndash; Grappler infinites and all. The only change I&rsquo;d make is to tone down the methods each character can use to remove white life, since the prevalence of white life removal in even basic combos meant that people didn&rsquo;t really get to play around with the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conversion&rdquo; mechanic, a system which effectively acts like <em>Tatsunoko vs Capcom</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baroque&rdquo; mechanic, except it turns your recoverable life into meter instead of damage. This is a really cool mechanic with a lot of potential, and I think the game would hugely benefit from giving players more opportunities to actually use it.</p>
<p>When almost every new fighting game out there wants me to be smart, thoughtful or just to play in a certain way, 8ing has made <em>DNF Duel</em>, a game which asks only that I fuck around and find out. That&rsquo;s the energy I need going into 2022.</p>
<h3 id="i-finally-started-hackgu-and-this-is-why-you-did-not-see-me-for-two-months">I FINALLY STARTED .HACK//G.U. AND THIS IS WHY YOU DID NOT SEE ME FOR TWO MONTHS</h3>
<p>The <em>.hack</em> games have always been on the sidelines for me, waiting for me to finally dive into them. I&rsquo;ve been familiar with the series for a long time, having watched its two main anime seasons, <em>.hack//SIGN</em> and <em>.hack//Roots</em> back when I was in high school and thoroughly loving both of them. I&rsquo;d attempted to play the original <em>.hack</em> quadrilogy once before, but found the first game, <em>.hack//Infection</em>, to be unreasonably punishing in many respects despite the fact that I absolutely adore the way it commits to the feel of being an MMORPG from the early 2000s. Of course, those games being PS2-exclusive (as of this writing) renders them fairly inaccessible as well, which fortunately cannot be said for its follow-ups, the <em>.hack//G.U.</em> games &ndash; <em>Rebirth</em>, <em>Reminisce</em> and <em>Redemption</em> &ndash; which are all available alongside a brand-new fourth episode, <em>Reconnection</em>, in the HD remaster bundle <em>.hack//G.U. Last Recode</em>. I have thoroughly loved the experience, and while I&rsquo;m not quite done with the series just yet, I finished the first two episodes before the end of the year so I&rsquo;m gonna say that counts.</p>
<p>While the <em>G.U.</em> games forego some of the feel of playing a janky MMORPG in favour of a more player-friendly action-RPG combat system, the general presentation remains, and it uses that presentation as its key asset as a means of diegetically expanding the game&rsquo;s lore &ndash; from the player character&rsquo;s PC desktop, you can log into &ldquo;The World R:2&rdquo;, the game within the game where most of the story takes place, you can read and reply to emails in order to explore and build relationships with other characters, or read the news and community forums to get a sense of what&rsquo;s going on in the world outside of the game. There&rsquo;s a lot to love about the <em>.hack</em> franchise, but this presentation style, for me, is chief among them.</p>
<p>It also helps that the story is quite compelling as well, with a lot of threads involving how online spaces affect the ways we perceive both ourselves and others, the ways in which corporate malice and/or incompetence can make these spaces actively harmful and dangerous, and what it means to truly connect with people you care about. There are also a lot of beating stuff up with giant swords and scythes and gunblades and summoning your digital stand so you can fight viruses that look like giant spiders made out of slime. It&rsquo;s pretty rad.</p>
<p>Speaking of giant swords and what-have-you, the core gameplay is pretty fun as well, with the action-RPG combat system lending itself to a fair amount of fun and expressive ways to engage enemies, especially as you progress and unlock more weapon types to use, as well as figure out how to utilise the game&rsquo;s pretty generous windows for cancelling attacks into skills or the recovery of those attacks into a guard. You can even bounce enemies of the wall for funky juggles, and while you&rsquo;re not gonna be seeing a <em>.hack//G.U.</em> combo MAD any time soon, it still feels pretty sick pulling off a crazy extended wall bounce combo with repeated animation cancels. It&rsquo;s all helped by a really flexible equipment customisation system, with slotted abilities on weapons, armour and accessories able to be added or removed on a whim, and all of those abilities being items that can be found in dungeons. The system allows you to really make how you play the game your own, while also allowing you to freely experiment with different builds at any given time without making you rely on getting specific equipment sets.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for what the experience would have been like back when these games were first releasing on the PS2, but <em>.hack//G.U.</em>&rsquo;s episodic structure<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> really helps sell the drama and tension of key elements of the game&rsquo;s narrative, as well as helping to set clear points to measure the growth of the main character, Haseo &ndash; a classic &ldquo;jerk with a heart of gold&rdquo; archetype who only pushes people away for fear of losing them. No wonder this guy is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai. The entire main cast is all a lot of fun to spend time with, each with their own quirks, hang-ups and interesting motivations &ndash; especially Atoli, whose initial portrayal as innocent and optimistic to the point of naivety, sets her up to be an excellent foil to the jaded loner that Haseo is introduced as, giving both characters a jumping off point from which they can learn important lessons about themselves and become better people as a result. It also helps that Atoli is very very cute and I love her dearly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, I would definitely recommend picking the game up. It&rsquo;s on Steam, and is usually pretty cheap when it goes on sale.</p>
<hr>
<p>So that was my 2021 in video games. It wasn&rsquo;t all peachy, to be sure, and I learned some things about my taste in fighting games that I was maybe not prepared to learn, but I still had a good time overall.

This insecurity has long since passed, now that I&amp;rsquo;m older and generally more confident, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I do reflect on from time to time. After all, when you&amp;rsquo;re surrounded by so many people who can do incredible things &amp;ndash; visual artists, graphic designers, musicians, voice over artists and just about everything else you can think of &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to feel like you need to &amp;ldquo;measure up&amp;rdquo; to them in some way, and equally hard not to feel discouraged or even depressed when you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;create&amp;rdquo; works of art the way the people around you are seemingly able to.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to be very insecure about my creative ability.</p>
<p>This insecurity has long since passed, now that I&rsquo;m older and generally more confident, but it&rsquo;s something that I do reflect on from time to time. After all, when you&rsquo;re surrounded by so many people who can do incredible things &ndash; visual artists, graphic designers, musicians, voice over artists and just about everything else you can think of &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard not to feel like you need to &ldquo;measure up&rdquo; to them in some way, and equally hard not to feel discouraged or even depressed when you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;create&rdquo; works of art the way the people around you are seemingly able to.<br>
Of course, the creation of art, and &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; in general, doesn&rsquo;t actually work like this. If societies and the people in them are, as Marx once put it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, products of their own material cicumstances, then it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that each individual person&rsquo;s art, whatever shape it may take, is simply the culmination of every work of art they&rsquo;ve ever engaged with. Not exactly a new idea &ndash; &ldquo;there are no truly original works&rdquo; is kind of just a fact of art as a whole. But, y&rsquo;know, there are plenty of artistic pursuits where the artists not only draw on influences from other works, but create art that is entirely contingent on the existence of works made by others. I want to talk about those works, and why they can comfortably be called &ldquo;art&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But first, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFyubsqKCE">this song</a>.</p>
<p>The artist known only as &ldquo;pluffaduff&rdquo; has been at this mashup business for a while now, but started gaining notoriety a few years ago when their musical creations were picked up on by high-profile members of the <em>Clone Hero</em> content creation sphere, primarily Acai and JasonParadise. Mashups have been around in music spheres for a <em>long-ass time</em> &ndash; they&rsquo;re a staple part of any self-respecting DJ&rsquo;s repertoire &ndash; but artists like pluffaduff really highlight just how much creativity, energy and passion go into a form of musical composition that can only exist because countless others have composed countless pieces of music before them. There&rsquo;s novelty to it, sure, but it&rsquo;s also an entirely new listening experience that feels more like a part of the artist than of any of the other artists whose works went into the final product&rsquo;s composition.</p>
<p>Now, read <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/11/cowboy-bebop-netflix-review-1234678880/">this review of Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> adaptation</a>. I promise we won&rsquo;t actually spend that much time talking about <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the existence of this adaptation in and of itself is proof of the ability to create something <em>mostly</em> new<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> out of someone else&rsquo;s creation, I think the more pertinent point to focus on is this particular review of the adaptation. David Ehrlich spends time talking about the moral and artistic merits of adapting <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> in this way, as well as in general, and spends much time discussing what the original show has to say, and consequently, what its adaptation completely misses. Again, this is not peculiar &ndash; literary analysis and artistic criticism have existed since forever. But it&rsquo;s the way that these analyses and critiques are used to discuss broader ideas about the concept of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, and of filmmaking as a whole, in some respects, that shows just what goes into art criticism. And it&rsquo;s hard to deny the art of criticism when so many critics have <em>such</em> a way with words.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new show is the product of a culture that exhumes yesterday because it’s run out of fresh ideas for tomorrow, and its vision of the future is so sterile and uninspired that it often feels like nothing more than a cheap vision of the waking life that everyone in Watanabe’s original was trying so hard to sleep off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And much like mashups, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly an art form &ndash; an art form that can only exist due to the works of art created by the people around us.</p>
<p>Humans are honestly incredible, when you get right down to it. We make <em>everything</em> &ndash; from the tools we use to get our necessities, to the technologies we use in our day to day life, to just about everything in between. I believe that humanity is, at its core, a creative species. We create the world around us, and the many works of art that serve as a means to express ourselves in that world, essentially as a compulsion. We can&rsquo;t help ourselves &ndash; creating is just what we do.</p>
<p>And if the things you create can only be given form by that which others have created? That&rsquo;s fantastic &ndash; after all, music production and music fusion, art and art criticism, are not adversarial relationships. They&rsquo;re collaborative.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s create together.</p>

			<description>I think, fundamentally, engaging with any video game (but especially a fighting game) is akin to a conversation between developer and player.
As a developer, your goal should be to confidently communicate your game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics to your player, and trust that the player will be able to keep up. There&amp;rsquo;s a delicate balance here, though &amp;ndash; say too little, and your player won&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable contributing to the conversation on their own.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think, fundamentally, engaging with any video game (but especially a fighting game) is akin to a conversation between developer and player.<br>
As a developer, your goal should be to confidently communicate your game&rsquo;s mechanics to your player, and trust that the player will be able to keep up. There&rsquo;s a delicate balance here, though &ndash; say too little, and your player won&rsquo;t feel comfortable contributing to the conversation on their own. Say too much, however, and the player won&rsquo;t have any room to express themselves on their own terms.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I wrote this &ldquo;conversation analogy&rdquo; with respect to a little fighting game called <em>Fantasy Strike</em>, a creation of the not-so-little game developer and noted Low Strong Presser, David Sirlin. You see, it was to be the target of my ire for a follow up to my piece from 2020, <a href="https://sleepmodeblog.wordpress.com/2020/04/27/new-players-are-not-stupid/">&ldquo;New Players Are Not Stupid&rdquo;</a>, where I would talk about what happens when you make a Fighting Game For Dummies. But the world has a funny way of changing your plans. Because while I did end up writing that follow up piece &ndash; this very one you&rsquo;re reading right now &ndash; it&rsquo;s not about <em>Fantasy Strike</em>. At least, not any more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you look through the history of the <em>Guilty Gear</em> franchise, comparing which entries are considered genuinely deep and engaging competitive experiences with which entries are liable to cause their players to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_YEB0ZOSc&amp;t=242s">loudly proclaim &ldquo;KUSOGE&rdquo; at a publisher-sponsored tournament</a>, you start to get the impression that, throughout the series' 23-year-long tenure, none of its iterations were ever really &ldquo;developed&rdquo; so much as they all just seemed to&hellip; <em>happen</em> within the Arc System Works offices, like mould growing in a petrie dish. Or, perhaps more accurately, in the back of the break room fridge. In this view, it starts to seem more and more miraculous that there are any good <em>Guilty Gear</em> games at all &ndash; the games that manage to land in that first category all seem to be there entirely by accident. To quote my good friend <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Pichy_and_Pals/">Hans &ldquo;Pichy&rdquo; Stockmann</a>, who points to the notorious <em>Guilty Gear XX Slash</em> as an example of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Slash is the first ASW game with intentionality to its design, and it still proves my thesis that this company cannot do math, hates math, and should never try designing games in a way that requires it.&quot;<br>
&ndash; <strong>Pichy on That Time Ky Was Top One, 2021</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so, when Daisuke Ishiwatari and Akira Katano told fans that the newest entry in the series, <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>, would be a &ldquo;complete reconstruction of the franchise&rdquo;, it came with an implication that many of us didn&rsquo;t catch on to &ndash;
by starting from the ground up, <em>Strive</em> had inadvertently billed itself as the first <em>Guilty Gear</em> title to actually be, well&hellip; <em>designed</em>. Early on, I predicted that the presence of actual design intent would be what separated <em>Strive</em> from other games in the series. A few months after release, I now know that I was correct &ndash; and that my prediction was, in hindsight, more like a warning.</p>
<p>As a point of comparison, let&rsquo;s take a step back and talk about the other most popular entry in the <em>Guilty Gear</em> series: <em>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R</em> (which I&rsquo;ll be referring to as <em>ACPR</em> for short).<br>
Viewing the totality of that game&rsquo;s various design elements &ndash; system mechanics and characters alike &ndash; it becomes increasingly clear that the game is completely <em>asburd</em>, full of all kinds of unbelievable bullshit that simply wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to exist in any other fighting game released in the current age. Like, I&rsquo;ve seen people very genuinely consider quitting the game because of Justice, a character whose extremely polarised gameplan makes her mid-tier <a href="http://curryallergy.blogspot.com/2008/11/super-turbo-new-arcadia-diagram.html">in the same way that E.Honda is mid tier in <em>Super Turbo</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, all because in spite of those limitations she still manages to be one of the most toxic zoners I have ever encountered in any fighting game.<br>
Despite <em>ACPR</em>&rsquo;s endless stream of frustrations and ways in which the game seems determined to ignore your desires and intentions at every juncture, it remains extremely popular because of Arc System Works' historically hands-off approach to the fine-tuning of character and systems balance (even to the extent that <em>ACPR</em> was an attempt to do just that with <em>Accent Core</em>) &ndash; rather than being a tightly choreographed competitive experience, the game system and its characters are instead allowed to exist in a somewhat unfiltered manner, and the meta becomes to be defined by <strong>emergent gameplay</strong> rather than strict developer intentions.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergent gameplay&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t refer explicitly to doing things in a game outside of what the developers intended for players to do, of course. The name gives it away, really &ndash; the appeal of a game like <em>ACPR</em> is the fact that, for all its faults, it is a game that feels a lot like a fighting game sandbox, where players are just given tools and are then simply allowed to figure out which ways they want to use those tools. Strategies and advanced gameplay emerge from experimentation, rather than through developer dictates. This is usually what people mean when they say older <em>Guilty Gear</em> titles allow for a high degree of &ldquo;player expression&rdquo; &ndash; the game generally allows you to do whatever you imagine to be possible with the tools at your disposal, irrespective of whether or not doing that might be a good idea.</p>
<p>And thus enters <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>, a game where you can only use your tools in the limited, narrow ways that <em><strong>Daisuke&rsquo;s Vision</strong></em> allows you to. A game that gives you a hammer, then tells you that the hammer may only be used to hit the nail.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Much has been made of the mechanics of <em>Strive</em>, both in my writings and elsewhere. <a href="https://sleepmodeblog.wordpress.com/2020/04/22/guilty-gear-strive-the-gear-that-never-will-be/">Last time I covered the game</a>, it was just after the end of the first closed beta test held in April 2020, and while some minor details have changed, the game is still largely the same as it was back then. Plenty has been said already about what <em>Strive&rsquo;s</em> mechanics are and what they mean for the game as a whole, so we won&rsquo;t be focusing on that here. Instead, I want to focus on the &ldquo;why&rdquo; &ndash; why are <em>Strive&rsquo;s</em> mechanics designed the way that they are, and what influenced those design decisions?</p>
<p>As a starting point for this analysis, I&rsquo;ll present my thesis statement: where <em>ACPR</em> told players to <strong>experiment</strong>, <em>Strive</em> tells players to <strong>optimise</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, when I say &ldquo;optimise&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean it in the sense that someone in your character&rsquo;s twitter hashtag has found a way to squeeze 10 more damage out of your jump-in punish. Instead, I&rsquo;m talking about a broader trend in modern fighting game design which I believe <em>Strive</em> epitomises &ndash; a trend which emphasises designing systems and toolkits such that the learning curve is as smooth as possible, and players can more quickly begin to make the &ldquo;good&rdquo; decisions in gamplay (commonly phrased as getting new players to &ldquo;play the real game sooner&rdquo;). In other words, it&rsquo;s design that optimises decision-making.<br>
If you&rsquo;re developing a fighting game intended to have mass-market appeal, this seems like a pretty reasonable compromise. You don&rsquo;t want your game to seem so dense and complex that it becomes inscrutable to anyone who isn&rsquo;t already a capital-letter Fighting Game Player, but you also don&rsquo;t want to make things too easy, lest you make match pacing extremely volatile and cause another round of complaining about comeback mechanics. So rather than making winning itself easier, you instead make it easier for people to ascertain what decisions might allow them to win &ndash; which generally means designing the tools available to players in a way that gives them very clear use cases. This is an anti-air, this is a reversal, this is a poke. The big problem with this approach, however, is that in making the use cases of these moves clear, you also make them much more narrow. This is an anti-air, this is a reversal, this is a poke &ndash; and nothing else. The hammer may only be used to hit the nail.</p>
<p>This is all above board (I guess) when you&rsquo;re making something totally new, but what happens when you&rsquo;re working from an established base? In this case, the flattening of the learning curve, the optimisation of decision-making, will invariably result in some things being removed or changed beyond recognition. The professional term for this is &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo;, or so I&rsquo;m told. <em>Strive</em> gives us numerous examples of this design ethos, both on a system and an individual character level.<br>
We can point to a number of ways this manifests on a system level &ndash; the inaccessibility of Instant Blocking and the strange decision to attach guard cancels to the Roman Cancel mechanic<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> come to mind &ndash; but I think if we want to talk about the streamlining of system mechanics, we have to talk about the gatling system, don&rsquo;t we?<br>
Gatlings (aka chain combos) in every <em>Guilty Gear</em> game prior to <em>Strive</em> certainly had intriciacies, thanks to slightly different chain routes for each character, but the system was largely predicated on a pretty simple rule &ndash; if you press a light attack button, you can press the next strength button up from that, and then you do the next attack. It&rsquo;s a very simple &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; formula that&rsquo;s pretty easy to get to grips with. Whatever sequence of buttons you want to use, you can probably pull that sequence off, even if it might not be the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; sequence to use. <em>Strive</em> cuts down the number of total gatling options available to every character and makes every chain route universal (the details of which I won&rsquo;t get into, just <a href="https://dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=GGST/Movement#Gatling_Combination">read the Dustloop wiki</a>) &ndash; what&rsquo;s of note here, however, is <em>which</em> gatling options were made available. The thinking behind which gatling options are available seems to be based on which ones were most commonly used by players in a match setting. 2K &gt; 2D was a really common sequence for a lot of characters, after all. If that&rsquo;s what you were most likely to be doing with the K button in most situations, why should you need to do anything else?<br>
Other restrictions can probably be explained with the ethos of mitigating reward from particular moves. P is a low commitment means of checking offense, so you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to confirm a usable knockdown from it. K is a reasonably fast poke, so you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get your big combos from it. If you want the big combos, you need to use the S and H buttons. The hammer may only be used to hit the nail.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s just the system. If we really want to get into the definition, the <em>true face</em> of <em>Strive</em>&rsquo;s design ethos, we need to talk characters &ndash; specifically, the game&rsquo;s resident King of the Jungle (and the tier list), one Sol Badguy.<br>
In <em>ACPR</em>, Sol was a fairly middle-of-the-road character who was definitely aggressive, but not exactly rushdown. He certainly excelled in the close range thanks to his myriad tools that allowed for powerful frame traps and strike/throw mixups, and while he did also struggle against characters who play well at long ranges, he had a number of unique, aggressive movement options to navigate around them. In <em>Strive</em>, Sol is honestly much the same character, but subjected to that &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo; process I mentioned. This process is endemic to the whole of <em>Strive</em> &ndash; many characters have significantly less tools they can use compared to previous games, less verbs with which players can express their ideas for the game and their character<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> &ndash; and I think we see this pretty sharply when comparing both iterations of Sol.<br>
For starters, there&rsquo;s the separation of Bandit Revolver and Bandit Bringer into separate moves, partly facilitated by the qualitative changes to Bandit Revolver from previous entries &ndash; rather than being an arcing kick that causes a hard knockdown, it now simply moves directly forward, being a standard meterless combo ender and common Roman Cancel point. Bandit Bringer itself is also effectively a replacement for Sol&rsquo;s divekick special from the <em>Xrd</em> games, repurposing an existing special move to serve the function of another, while largely removing the utility of the first iteration, mostly because its utility was somewhat limited and situational. There&rsquo;s also Wild Throw, whose entire utility as a command grab that starts freeform air combos has been gutted in favour of just having all the damage front-loaded into the throw itself. After all, that&rsquo;s the damage you should be getting from the move anyway. Its only utility outside of that now rests with its invulnerability to throws &ndash; a property afforded to all command grabs in <em>Strive</em> so that they can beat attempts by the opponent to break your normal throw. The hammer may only be used to hit the nail.</p>
<p>But the star of the show, really, is the meme move beloved by Sol players everywhere &ndash; this is the part where we talk about Riot Stamp.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><br>
Riot Stamp is honestly the most <em>Guilty Gear</em> move in <em>Guilty Gear</em>. A flying kick that requires Sol to bounce off the wall behind him before flying towards the opponent, kicking them in the dome and maybe netting a combo. While it does have some situational (and very gimmicky) uses, it is largely a trick. In most situations, the move is trivially easy for the opponent to counter, and the reward you get from landing it compared to the risk you face by allowing your opponent to smack you with their strongest anti-air while you&rsquo;re helplessly flying at them boot-first is not worth it. You don&rsquo;t want to use this move.<br>
Except, you totally do. Because it&rsquo;s <strong>hilarious</strong>.<br>
Specifically the move is hilarious <em>because</em> you don&rsquo;t want to use it. See, humour is predicated on the subversion of expectation, and Riot Stamp can be a fantastic subversion of both players' expectations &ndash; the opponent probably didn&rsquo;t expect to see it come out because of how gimmicky it is, and the Sol player probably didn&rsquo;t expect it to work. The highly situational nature of the move adds to this, as well. After all, it may be the World&rsquo;s Most Obvious Overhead, but it&rsquo;s a bit less obvious when the Sol player does it with their back to the corner, making the startup significantly faster due to the elimination of any travel time to the wall behind him. Even funnier if you do it at the most midscreen position possible, and it still manages to work purely because it caught the opponent so off guard that they screwed up their anti-air. It&rsquo;s a window into the design ethos of a game like <em>ACPR</em> &ndash; it exists for no other reason than &ldquo;just because&rdquo;, and players are allowed to make their own fun with it.</p>
<p>In a way, though, Riot Stamp is also a window into the design ethos of <em>Strive</em> &ndash; because it isn&rsquo;t there.<br>
There really isn&rsquo;t much more to say. Instead of giving players a sub-optimal tool and letting them figure out their preferred uses for it, the tool was simply taken away with no replacement because using it is not explicitly a good idea. If you want to hit the nail, you may only use a hammer.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the goal of this design ethos is to lower the skill floor without changing the skill ceiling. If playing fighting games competently is broadly about making good decisions about what tools to use and when, then making the use cases clear and obvious should allow for more people to reach a level of competency without affecting the consistency of top level play. And while it doesn&rsquo;t exactly achieve the opposite, it does, I think, serve to lower the skill ceiling regardless. After all, if playing fighting games competently is broadly about making good decisions about what tools to use and when, then one of the most important skills is learning about (or even discovering) those edge case uses for your more niche tools, or even innovating new ways of using tools whose use cases might otherwise seem cut and dry. If the hammer may only be used to hit the nail, then not only are you foregoing any other means of hitting the nail, you&rsquo;re also foregoing any other uses the hammer may provide.</p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> is a game which, in the pursuit of clarity of intent, allows its metagame to be dictated by those intentions rather than by what the players make of it. The issues with the game&rsquo;s design are numerous, but I think it all comes back to this design ethos &ndash; a philosophy of not trusting your players to learn and discover the intricacies of the game themselves. A philosophy of not respecting the intelligence of new players.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><br>
<em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> is The Fighting Game For Dummies. And if you ask me, players of any skill level, Dummies or otherwise, deserve better than this.</p>

<p><em>Strive</em>&rsquo;s take on Roman Cancels actually presents its own host of problematic design conclusions that are worth discussing, but I may tackle that in a separate article to prevent this one from getting too bloated.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A friend of mine counted this, actually &ndash; in <em>ACPR</em>, Anji has a total of 46 options in his whole move list (both Anji-specific moves and his versions of universal tools), while in <em>Strive</em>, Anji only has 30 (32 if you&rsquo;re being generous).&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re probably thinking of Dragon Install, but that doesn&rsquo;t count because Dragon Install is on another character in <em>Strive</em>, and also way less funny &ndash; because it&rsquo;s just plain bad.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>And arguably legacy players, to be honest.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<description>Welcome.
This is my new blog, hosted on Github Pages and running on Hugo (after much fighting with inscrutable software dev nerd shit). It&amp;rsquo;s here because I got sick of Wordpress being clunky and locking useful quality of life features behind a paywall. Hopefully this way you won&amp;rsquo;t need uBlock Origin so much.
For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, the old blog is not being deleted, just deprecated &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping all of my old writings there for archival purposes.</description>

<p>This is my new blog, hosted on Github Pages and running on Hugo (after much fighting with inscrutable software dev nerd shit). It&rsquo;s here because I got sick of Wordpress being clunky and locking useful quality of life features behind a paywall. Hopefully this way you won&rsquo;t need uBlock Origin so much.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the old blog is not being deleted, just deprecated &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be keeping all of my old writings there for archival purposes. If you&rsquo;d like to read them again, they&rsquo;re all still on <a href="https://sleepmodeblog.wordpress.com/">the old blog.</a></p>
<p>Somewhat unfortunately, this does mean that you won&rsquo;t be able to receive notifications for when new articles come up, thanks to the lack of a follow feature or some equivalent. If you&rsquo;d like to stay up to date on when new articles come out, I&rsquo;ll post links on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/SleepmodeAU">my Twitter feed</a>.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for more writing.</p>
