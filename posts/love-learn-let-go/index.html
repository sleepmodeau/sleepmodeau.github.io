				<p>Prior to <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> and <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, Arc System Works' three most prolific and popular fighting games were <em>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R</em>, <em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2</em> and <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>. These are all games I&rsquo;ve spent varying &ndash; but generally large &ndash; amounts of time with, and my opinions of them have varied accordingly. My rocky relationship with all three of these games is well-documented, here and elsewhere, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve come to a pretty clear idea of how I feel about all these games. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about this time.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-love-coming-back-to-guilty-gear-xrd">Learning to Love: Coming back to Guilty Gear Xrd<a href="#learning-to-love-coming-back-to-guilty-gear-xrd" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p><em>Guilty Gear Xrd</em> is a game which made a great first impression, and then gradually lost its appeal the more I began to understand what it was doing. I &ndash; along with lots of other people &ndash; did not like the effect that the game&rsquo;s Yellow Roman Cancel had on its pacing, decision-making and general flow. It&rsquo;s a very, <em>very</em> powerful mechanic, and the general pattern was that if you didn&rsquo;t like it, you <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t like it. While I wasn&rsquo;t expecting my opinion on <em>Xrd</em>&rsquo;s YRC to change any time soon, my experience with <em>ACPR</em> (which I&rsquo;ll be outlining soon) left me wondering if I&rsquo;d come away from more time spent with <em>Xrd</em> &ndash; a game I hadn&rsquo;t played in years &ndash; feeling more positive about it.</p>
<p>The answer to that question is&hellip; kind of?</p>
<p>I played a long set with my day-one <em>Rev2</em> Venom against my friend <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Toneblerones">Toneblerone</a> and his region-dominating Jack-O'. I didn&rsquo;t go in expecting to win, especially when coming up against a character as heavy on the knowledge checks as Jack-O', but man, that didn&rsquo;t feel good. And she&rsquo;s mid-tier?</p>
<p>Anyway, my overwhelming impression coming from <em>Rev2</em> is that it&rsquo;s definitely a game that I like more than I dislike, because for all of its elements that I don&rsquo;t vibe with, it&rsquo;s still largely based on a fighting game that I genuinely do like. I&rsquo;d like to say that I have problems with the way <em>Xrd</em>&rsquo;s new characters were designed, but my lack of experience with the game&rsquo;s high level meta, combined with my slightly more extensive background in <em>ACPR</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is like. Do I get any right to complain? They are at least mechanically interesting, especially in the case of Jack-O' and Ramlethal.</p>
<p>I did, however, have my dislike of YRC heavily solidified. I&rsquo;m not opposed to &ldquo;pause button&rdquo; mechanics in fighting games on principle, and I&rsquo;m definitely fine with <em>Xrd</em>&rsquo;s trademark slowdown on the game&rsquo;s other Roman Cancels, but YRC does so much, and so well, for so little cost, comparatively speaking. There are certainly interesting things you can do with it, and I don&rsquo;t want to discount that, but the fact that there are so few restrictions on it, on top of the way that RC slowdown eats your opponent&rsquo;s inputs and even grants you some invincibility when you perform it just makes it so, like, unbelievably strong, but more importantly, it&rsquo;s strong in a very homogeneous way. Not everyone uses YRC in exactly the same ways, but everyone can take advantage of it in similar enough ways that it just makes the mechanic feel less interesting than any of the war crimes <em>ACPR</em>&rsquo;s cast can commit, even if it&rsquo;s arguably more egregious than doing move &gt; YRC &gt; air throw.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d play very much <em>Rev2</em> if it got rollback, but I definitely feel more sympathetic towards the people that would. People love this game, and despite my mechanical gripes, I completely understand why they do. All signs point to this game not getting a rollback update (at least not in any official sense), but it really does deserve one.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-learn-accent-core-r-and-attitude-adjustment">Learning to Learn: Accent Core +R and Attitude Adjustment<a href="#learning-to-learn-accent-core-r-and-attitude-adjustment" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>I love this game. No, really! I know what I&rsquo;ve said about the game in the, uh, <a href="https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/2021-games-recap">very recent past</a>, but&hellip; okay, let me tell you what happened.</p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear</em> &ndash; the entire thing, not just <em>Accent Core</em> &ndash; is a very selfish game. This is how Lord Knight described the game, but while he meant it in the sense that &ldquo;every player hates every character that isn&rsquo;t their own&rdquo;, I mean it in the sense that <em>Guilty Gear</em> is a game where your success as a player is contingent almost entirely on locking your opponent out of their ability to play the game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a real &ldquo;mom said it&rsquo;s my turn on the Xbox&rdquo; kind of game. Which makes sense &ndash; every character is capable of some truly <em>abominable</em> stuff<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> &ndash; and understanding this is key to getting maximum enjoyment from the game. It took me a good while to understand that.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;quit&rdquo; <em>ACPR</em> a few times now. I&rsquo;ve run the gamut of excuses, blaming my opponents, myself, even both at the same time! But despite all my complaining about &ldquo;the Australian Regional Meta&rdquo; and whatever, whenever I stopped playing, I kept feeling like I still wasn&rsquo;t giving the game a fair chance. I said I&rsquo;d rather pick the bullshit that I like, but do I really, actually dislike <em>ACPR</em>&rsquo;s brand of bullshit? Or am I just giving up because I don&rsquo;t get easy-mode answers to the problems that are most commonly presented to me?</p>
<p>I determined that it was the latter. So I came back one last time, trying to keep my mind as open as possible, not just to what my opponents might want to do, but also to novel ways to approach the game as a whole. In doing so, I discovered the true beauty of <em>ACPR</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a game where there&rsquo;s always a strategy or technique I&rsquo;ve never thought of, an answer I&rsquo;d never considered.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> And while my ideas don&rsquo;t always pan out &ndash; Justice is still a pain in the ass to fight &ndash; my capacity to come up with new ideas is making the experience feel much more rewarding.</p>
<p>Also, for what it&rsquo;s worth, my newfound attitude towards this game has once again allowed me to both appreciate the game&rsquo;s sense of humour even more, AND truly recognise when my opponent&rsquo;s do Genuinely Cool Shit. It&rsquo;s good to be back.</p>
