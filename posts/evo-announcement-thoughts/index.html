<p>Anyway, here are my scattered thoughts on some of the bigger announcements that were made at the 2022 edition of Evo, everyone&rsquo;s favourite fighting game trade show masquerading as a tournament.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="capcom">Capcom<a href="#capcom" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>
<p>Capcom revealed two new characters for the upcoming <em>Street Fighter 6</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWd7EGiQuzk">Juri Han and Kimberly</a>. I&rsquo;ve already been fairly impressed by what Capcom is doing with the game itself, so for the first time in a long time I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to seeing what a new <em>Street Fighter</em> game has in store.</p>
<p>Juri is a very expected addition &ndash; she&rsquo;s a very popular character, especially among the significant coomer subset of the FGC, and doubly so now that she&rsquo;s been given a brand new e-girl visual touch-up. Gameplay-wise, I&rsquo;m glad that she seems to be a little bit closer to her <em>Street Fighter IV</em> incarnation, though presumably with enough of her <em>Street Fighter V</em> design elements to make her a fusion of the two. I&rsquo;ve heard reports that she doesn&rsquo;t require Fuhajin charges in order to perform the requisite attacks, and that Fuhajin charges only power up the attacks, which sounds like a really fun change for the character.</p>
<p>I already really like Kimberly. Granted, I&rsquo;ve got a bias towards the series&rsquo; Bushinryu practitioners &ndash; Guy is still one of my favourite characters in the series. That said, even with her sneaker ninja pedigree, Kimberly looks like a really fun take on the character style that really leans into the street art kind of aesthetic that <em>Street Fighter 6</em> as a whole is representing. I love the use of the spray paint cans as her version of a &ldquo;torinoko&rdquo; smoke bomb, and her trailer shows off a lot of the fun things you can do with the game&rsquo;s juggle system.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty excited to see what <em>Street Fighter 6</em> has in store for us!</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;know, for once, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to be a grump about new <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> content.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re anywhere near the internet, you&rsquo;ll know that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GYL5FVpjG4">Bridget was announced</a> as the game&rsquo;s newest playable character &ndash; a fan favourite, to be sure, so her return was a very welcome one. And as the pronoun I just used would imply, Bridget &ndash; now in series canon a trans woman &ndash; has brought about basically an entire week of widespread gender euphoria, especially with her presence in the game alongside Testament, who is now firmly established to be non-binary.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> is a game whose design goals offend almost every sensibility I have as a fan of the franchise, but the gameplay is as far as my disdain for it goes. As more and more characters have been added to the game, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate just how much thought and care is put into the visuals, the character designs, the narrative and how the characters are portrayed within that narrative. I adore the game&rsquo;s primary theme: &ldquo;the most difficult thing is to be yourself, but ultimately you will find more joy in that honesty with yourself than in anything else&rdquo;, and the last couple of character additions have really allowed that theme to resonate with so many people so much more explicitly than it may have before.</p>
<p>Will I miss Roger Rush? Sure. But for once, I&rsquo;m hardly convinced that it matters. I hope everyone who loves <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> continues to find more to love about it.</p>

<p>&hellip;eventually.
There&rsquo;s no date on it yet, but <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> will be getting an update sometime in the (hopefully) near future that will upgrade the game&rsquo;s online infrastructure to use rollback netcode. I don&rsquo;t really have a horse in the <em>DBFZ</em> race, but man &ndash; after everything those guys have been through, the least they deserve is playable online.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco concluded the <em>Tekken 7</em> grand finals with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTxIWcBSULc">a trailer announcing the return of the Tekken World Tour</a>, and with it, a new balance update. This update, like others before it, seems intent on bringing the game&rsquo;s current focus on strong counter-hit tools and explosive offense to the forefront, with a handful of characters gaining new launchers and situations for guaranteed hits and the like, as well as the addition of a brand new wall stagger mechanic, which appears to
create a situation where the opponent has to deal with a pure mid/low 50-50 mixup. My outsider&rsquo;s perspective initially took ire with the addition of even more counter hit launchers as <em>Tekken 7</em>&rsquo;s only apparent means of making characters stronger, but a friend of mine (and actual <em>Tekken</em> player) <a href="https://www.twitter.com/PeacecrabVal">Valerie</a> made a pretty convincing argument for the egregiousness of the new wall stagger mechanic &ndash; after all, <em>Tekken 7</em> is a game that already has a crazy number of situations where your options are either &ldquo;guess&rdquo; or &ldquo;die&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s hard to feel excited at the prospect of the game adding one more of them. But I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to see how it pans out.</p>
<p>But before you get much time to think about the implications of this new mechanic, you hear the song that plays in all of <em>Tekken: The First One</em>&rsquo;s endings. Suddenly, you&rsquo;re watching Kazuya&rsquo;s ending, as his stiff, low-poly model tosses Heihachi&rsquo;s equally low-poly model off a cliff. And as the camera zooms in on Kazuya&rsquo;s face, ready for the most beautiful smile in all of fighting games, a hard cut &ndash; it&rsquo;s contemporary Kazuya, seemingly rendered in Unreal Engine 5. A disembodied voice simply says: &ldquo;Get Ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I guess <em>Tekken 8</em> is somewhere in the production pipeline. Presumably we&rsquo;ll get more details later, but man. What a trailer that was. I mean, I&rsquo;m mostly just biased because I think that Kazuya&rsquo;s <em>Tekken</em> ending FMV is an extremely important piece of FGC history, but I dunno, it worked on me. Let&rsquo;s see what Bandai Namco have to say after TWT finals in February.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve told this story a million times before; I really tried with 2019&rsquo;s <em>Samurai Shodown</em>. And not for nothing &ndash; the game had pretty broad appeal in my local fighting game scene. Easy to pick up with a friendly learning curve, fun characters and a tense, visceral match pace that always kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the game was held back by the lack of a PC port (most players in my scene play on PC at home) and even worse, god-awful online play.</p>
<p>So SNK is teaming up with Code Mystics to bring rollback netcode to <em>Samurai Shodown</em> by 2023. And more than the fact that people still want to play the game, and that I might get the chance to support the game as a commentator and tournament organiser once more, the thing that makes me happiest is that SNK didn&rsquo;t leave the game to die after all.</p>

<p><em>The King of Fighters XV</em> has been doing pretty well for itself, matchmaking issues notwithstanding. The game has already gotten a decent amount of support, with Team South Town (Geese, Billy, Yamazaki) and Team Garou (Rock, Gato, B.Jenet) already being released, and EVO gave us a little bit more. First, a trailer that more or less celebrates the release of Team Awakened Orochi (the Orochi versions of Chris, Yashiro and Shermie)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and then reveals the next DLC team &ndash; Team Samurai, a guest team consisting of <em>Samurai Shodown</em> characters Haohmaru, Nakoruru and Darli Dagger. On top of all this, we also got confirmation of a second season of DLC teams, with two character confirmations &ndash; fan favourite series veterans Shingo Yabuki and Kim Kaphwan. Both of these additions are notable, since Shingo hasn&rsquo;t been in a <em>KOF</em> game since <em>The King of Fighters XI</em> in 2005, while <em>KOFXV</em> marked the first time that Kim wasn&rsquo;t in the base roster of a <em>KOF</em> game at all.</p>
<p>Also, they confirmed that all versions of the game will be able to crossplay with each other by 2023. So that kicks ass! It&rsquo;s good to be a <em>KOF</em> fan.</p>

<p>A new <em>Fatal Fury</em> (or <em>Garou</em>) game has been greenlit. So far, all we know is that it exists, as well as its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YP3wVygHLg">key art and new rendition of Terry&rsquo;s theme &ldquo;Sunrise on the Train&rdquo;</a> suggesting that the game will be a narrative sequel to 1999&rsquo;s <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>. That&rsquo;s cool! I really hope it isn&rsquo;t a gameplay sequel, though.</p>
<p><em>Fatal Fury</em> is a series that has done a <em>lot</em> of really weird stuff by 2D fighting game standards, focusing on using 2D graphics to recreate an almost 3D fighting game dynamic thanks to its &ldquo;line sway&rdquo; system with two to three layers on the screen characters can occupy, and in the case of the <em>Real Bout Fatal Fury</em> games, a surprisingly extensive set of character-specific target combos and chain routes which allowed for very flexible offense and combo conversions. While I don&rsquo;t think that <em>Garou</em>&rsquo;s mechanical contributions should be left out entirely &ndash; I think that the T.O.P. system and Just Defend mechanics in particular are really interesting and fun &ndash; I think making the game play like a slightly expanded <em>Mark of the Wolves</em> would be doing the game a disservice, since it wouldn&rsquo;t really be doing a whole lot to differentiate itself from <em>The King of Fighters</em>. And to be completely honest, I think the FGC needs more weird fighting games anyway, so a new <em>Fatal Fury</em> game would be perfectly positioned to be just that by embracing the history of its predecessors.</p>

<p>That cynicism is less warranted now that the new management has managed to prove themselves as more than capable of making an event that is actually, like, really good. So.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
