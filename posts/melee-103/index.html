				<h1>Scattered Thoughts on Hax$&#39;s Melee 1.03</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>I&rsquo;ve had something of a tumultuous relationship with competitive <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>. After a period of playing Slippi unranked and encountering the most intense frustration I&rsquo;ve ever gotten from a fighting game, I&rsquo;ve since repeatedly left the game and come back to it, finding myself becoming softer and softer on the game each time I come back. As it stands now, I really feel like I have a strong appreciation for why people have played this game for so long &ndash; it&rsquo;s fast, dynamic, incredibly interactive and endlessly deep in its complexity, warts and all. Those warts are pretty obvious at this point, though, from wobbling controversies to bugs that cause the game to have variable input latency, and methods of fixing these issues have been a point of discussion in the community for what must certainly be years at this point. While many of these fixes are considered necessary for the smooth running of online play in the age of rollback <em>Melee</em>, the implementation of some of these fixes has been intentionally limited in scope so as to not change too much of the core of what makes <em>Melee</em> special for so many people &ndash; which may include a few of those warts.</p>
<p>On that note, high level <em>Melee</em> player<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Aziz &ldquo;Hax$&rdquo; Al-Yami recently made a series of videos discussing various changes and bugfixes that he would like to see implemented in <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> &ndash; not just online, but for offline play as well. These changes are comprised of fixing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew6XL5Pq8jc">polling drift bug</a>, extending the functionality of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uKDI8aBGQ">Universal Controller Fix</a> mod to make certain techniques much easier, arguing for the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOvt3oABABY">map jump to a shoulder button on the Gamecube controller</a>, and a proposition for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoX3cyMilOM">new competitive ruleset</a>. I&rsquo;ll briefly summarise each of these videos for the sake of context, but I invite you to watch them yourself so that you can get a full understanding for Hax$&rsquo;s arguments.</p>
<p>The first video on polling drift outlines a bug in <em>Melee</em> that causes the game to cycle between ordinary input delay and adding an extra half-frame of input delay approximately every 8 seconds, which causes many inputs to effectively be dropped at random. Fixing this is such a no-brainer that the Faster Melee development team added a fix for the bug in their first release of the game&rsquo;s unofficial netplay client back in 2016.<br>
The second video on Universal Controller Fix argues that the mod in its current form, contrary to its stated aims, does more than simply tie all controllers with the best possible controller, and should lean into this by allowing all controllers to hit the 1.0 X-axis cardinal on the left analog stick (to allow for stronger dashes/running), as well as increase the analog value ranges to allow for more consistent shield drops and dashback out of crouch. This is a set of changes with some potentially pretty important gameplay implications, but it definitely warrants exploration, I feel.<br>
The third video argues for a software solution to a feature currently exclusive to the custom Gamecube controller PCB known as the &ldquo;Goomwave&rdquo;, which allows for custom button remapping on the controller. Specifically, Hax$ suggests that <em>Melee</em> should allow players to map one of their shoulder buttons (L, R or Z) to jump as a means of decreasing executional strain on a number of important techniques for anyone not using a box-style controller. This does potentially have knock-on effects similar to the UCF adjustments, but would also largely alleviate the use of &ldquo;claw&rdquo; grips on controllers as a means of getting around the difficulty of instant aerials and other techniques involving the jump button.<br>
Finally, the fourth video proposes a new competitive ruleset, including a six-minute timer to allow for time-outs to become a more viable strategy without necessarily increasing their frequency, decreasing the currently existing ledge-grab limit to fit the new timer, adding an air-time limit for Jigglypuff to discourage stalling tactics, and making a number of adjustments to tournament-legal stages to decrease their ability to interfere with matches, similar to the freezing of Pokemon Stadium.</p>
<p>While some of these changes have pretty broad-reaching implications for the competitive meta of <em>Melee</em> that are honestly beyond my level of understanding, I generally agree with the ethos behind these changes, and I think they definitely warrant discussion among tournament organisers and members of the community so a decision about whether or not these changes are worth implementing.<br>
Hax$ doesn&rsquo;t really seem to think that discussion is warranted, though.</p>
