      <description>I think, fundamentally, engaging with any video game (but especially a fighting game) is akin to a conversation between developer and player.
As a developer, your goal should be to confidently communicate your game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics to your player, and trust that the player will be able to keep up. There&amp;rsquo;s a delicate balance here, though &amp;ndash; say too little, and your player won&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable contributing to the conversation on their own.</description>

      <description>Welcome.
This is my new blog, hosted on Github Pages and running on Hugo (after much fighting with inscrutable software dev nerd shit). It&amp;rsquo;s here because I got sick of Wordpress being clunky and locking useful quality of life features behind a paywall. Hopefully this way you won&amp;rsquo;t need uBlock Origin so much.
For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, the old blog is not being deleted, just deprecated &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping all of my old writings there for archival purposes.</description>

      <description>Orin (aka Sleepmode)
I&amp;rsquo;m an Australian video game enthusiast with a particular love of fighting games and arcade-style tests of skill. This place is usually where you can find me writing about those kinds of things. Older writings can be found on my Wordpress Blog, which is no longer in use because I hate QOL features being locked behind a paywall.
Links to my twitter, twitch and youtube channels can all be found below.</description>
