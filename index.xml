      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to making bad posts.&#xA;That sort of thing happens to the best of us from time to time. A misinformed take, a misplaced sentiment, a misspoken thought. Sometimes you make something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be made. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re just flat-out wrong about something.&#xA;This section of the website is basically a quarantine zone for all the times where I&amp;rsquo;ve done exactly that. I don&amp;rsquo;t want the works found here to be publicly distributed, necessarily, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth keeping them somewhere on the website if only for the sake of honesty and clarity.</description>

      <title>Sleepmode Year In Review: 2023 Edition</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/2023-recap/</link>

      <description>For most normal people, two weeks into the new year would be a pretty sensible time to put out a yearly retrospective piece. Unfortunately, I am not normal, and so the only reason why I didn&amp;rsquo;t get this piece out earlier is because my SSD died, and in replacing it, I temporarily lost access to this website&amp;rsquo;s local markdown files1, and thus was unable to do much of anything with the website until I got that sorted.</description>

      <title>Playing OutRun 2SP in $CURRENT_YEAR</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/outrun-2-in-current-year/</link>

      <description>In 1986, a man named Yu Suzuki, along with a small handful of developers at SEGA AM2, would release an arcade racing game called OutRun. Suzuki had previously made some fairly successful motorcycle racing games for SEGA by way of Hang-On and Enduro Racer, and with OutRun, he sought to create a racing game predicated primarily on allowing players to enjoy the experience of driving and, in his words, &amp;ldquo;feel superior&amp;rdquo;1.</description>

      <description>You guys don&amp;rsquo;t fucking know how to talk about anything. I mean, I know that Twitter as a format is basically anathema to actual discussion but you could at least try.&#xA;The Twitter account FightstickArt, ostensibly an account centered on showing off people&amp;rsquo;s cool fight sticks and artwork and stuff, took part in the time-honoured tradition of engagement farming by posing a question to FGC twitter: what&amp;rsquo;s most important to you in a fighting game?</description>

      <title>Sleepmode Year In Review: 2022 Edition</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/2022-recap/</link>

      <description>So, uh. I guess 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly 2021 Hard Mode, but we can&amp;rsquo;t exactly say there were many&amp;hellip; systemic improvements to the stuff that was fucked about last year, either. I&amp;rsquo;m at least doing okay on a personal level, which means I&amp;rsquo;m in a better position to be working with others to fight for those systemic improvements at least!&#xA;Anyway, this is gonna go on mostly the same beat as the last one of these, though it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be focused exclusively on games.</description>

      <title>Melee Is Sick, and I Don&#39;t Want to Play It</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older, more mature and more experienced with the fighting game genre, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to become pretty good at honestly assessing my feelings about particular games. This honesty really reached a strong point of development when I finally realised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like BlazBlue Central Fiction all that much (you can read about that in my article &amp;ldquo;Learning to Love, to Learn and to Let Go&amp;rdquo;), and it&amp;rsquo;s come to carry forward into another game which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fraught relationship with &amp;ndash; Super Smash Bros.</description>

      <title>NIKKE: First Impressions</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/archive/nikke-first-impressions/</link>

      <guid>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/archive/nikke-first-impressions/</guid>
      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s easy. The piece on Goddess of Victory: NIKKE is here because, to be quite frank, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give the game its due diligence. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that I actually think the game is good or anything - far from it. As I point out in the article itself, I&amp;rsquo;m not the target audience for these kinds of games&amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the problem. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really willing to properly engage with the game and its systems, and so I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend much time bothering to actually learn how the game worked when I played it, and that combined with a few people in my circles comparing it to popular rail shooters just didn&amp;rsquo;t leave me well-equipped to assess the game with much in the way of intellectual honesty or factual accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimising a Vroid Model for VRChat</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/vroid-vrchat-optimisation-guide/</link>

      <guid>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/vroid-vrchat-optimisation-guide/</guid>
      <description>A pretty popular and accessible way of creating custom avatars for VRChat is by using Vroid Studio, a program mostly used to create character models for vtubers. Unfortunately, VRChat has pretty strict limitations on how avatar models can actually be constructed and displayed in a session without setting people&amp;rsquo;s computers on fire1, and Vroid models by default will flagrantly ignore all those limitations in the pursuit of making your brand new anime femboy self-actualisation vehicle as cute as programmatically possible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve missed every discourse cycle for the past few months and god damn it I will not miss this one when there is #content to be created.&#xA;Anyway, here are my scattered thoughts on some of the bigger announcements that were made at the 2022 edition of Evo, everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite fighting game trade show masquerading as a tournament.1&#xA;Capcom Capcom revealed two new characters for the upcoming Street Fighter 6 &amp;ndash; Juri Han and Kimberly.</description>

      <title>Study Guide for Sarah Bryant - VF4FT</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/archive/hidden-vf4ft-sarah-study-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 21:36:56 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/archive/hidden-vf4ft-sarah-study-guide/</guid>
      <description>This post was originally written shortly after Virtua Fighter 4 Final Tuned had made its way onto Fightcade with rollback netcode. I was really interested in learning Sarah Bryant in that game, and while the resources certainly existed on VFDC, they were somewhat scattered and written in a very of-the-time style. I wrote this to be a kind of &amp;ldquo;cleaned up&amp;rdquo; and more central version of those resources, but when VFDC ended up adding VF4FT proper to its self-hosted wiki, I felt like keeping this up in public would have been stepping on some toes a little bit.</description>

      <title>The Spectator&#39;s Guide to Bloody Roar Extreme</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again: Combo Breaker is almost upon us. Of the many FGC majors sprinkled throughout the US, the Chicago, IL event is most notable for its emphasis on spotlighting novel, commuinty-driven brackets &amp;ndash; most notorious are its Mystery Game and Auction tournaments, including the cultural touchstone that was the Sarvets All-Stars tournament from 2018. And while these kinds of events are almost certainly appearing at Combo Breaker 2022, the main stage will also be seeing a new challenger among the likes of Guilty Gear Strive and The King of Fighters XV &amp;ndash; a Nintendo Gamecube game called Bloody Roar Extreme.</description>

      <description>Okay, full disclosure: this was never really made public to begin with. I wrote it in the lead-up to a Dead or Alive 2 tournament that Fraud Krew hosted back in 2022, and rather than risk the Australian Connection on a largely US tournament, I decided to lab out Ayane and see what I could find in the hope that maybe someone else could use this information in my stead.</description>

      <title>KOF XV Balance Change Proposals</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/kofxv-change-wishlist/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing The King of Fighters XV a lot lately. I think the game is very good, and overall the balance is pretty spot-on, but there are a few things that I think warrant some changes &amp;ndash; nothing drastic, just a few quality of life changes here and there. I&amp;rsquo;m putting them all here so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to see them all over your timeline. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to justify every proposal I&amp;rsquo;m making here.</description>

      <description>Prior to Guilty Gear Strive and Dragon Ball FighterZ, Arc System Works&amp;rsquo; three most prolific and popular fighting games were Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2 and BlazBlue Centralfiction. These are all games I&amp;rsquo;ve spent varying &amp;ndash; but generally large &amp;ndash; amounts of time with, and my opinions of them have varied accordingly. My rocky relationship with all three of these games is well-documented, here and elsewhere, but I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a pretty clear idea of how I feel about all these games.</description>

      <title>My New Year&#39;s Resolution</title>

      <description>In my last piece, I may have said a few things about my feelings on Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R and BlazBlue Central Fiction. Those feelings may have been largely negative feelings where I admitted my frustrations and losses came from a lack of knowledge, but then I rationalised my lack of desire to play these games as simply not wanting to fill those gaps in my knowledge.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like I was scrubquoting hard in doing so.</description>

      <title>Sleepmode&#39;s 2021 Gaming Recap</title>

      <description>So 2021 happened. I was originally going to introduce this piece with a brief overview of the political situation under COVID-19 as a way to contrast how awful the year was with some personal levity, but the idea of jumping from &amp;ldquo;the far right is growing out of an anti-vaccine movement while governments continue to glibly allow their citizens to die from a preventable disease and ordinary people try pick up the slack where their leaders and fascist/fascist-adjacent neighbours have failed&amp;rdquo; to talking about the video games I played this past year felt like a bit too strong of a tonal whiplash.</description>

      <description>I used to be very insecure about my creative ability.&#xA;This insecurity has long since passed, now that I&amp;rsquo;m older and generally more confident, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I do reflect on from time to time. After all, when you&amp;rsquo;re surrounded by so many people who can do incredible things &amp;ndash; visual artists, graphic designers, musicians, voice over artists and just about everything else you can think of &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to feel like you need to &amp;ldquo;measure up&amp;rdquo; to them in some way, and equally hard not to feel discouraged or even depressed when you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;create&amp;rdquo; works of art the way the people around you are seemingly able to.</description>

      <title>New Players Are Not Stupid Pt.2</title>
      <link>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/new-players-are-not-stupid-2/</link>

      <guid>https://sleepmodeau.github.io/posts/new-players-are-not-stupid-2/</guid>
      <description>I think, fundamentally, engaging with any video game (but especially a fighting game) is akin to a conversation between developer and player.&#xA;As a developer, your goal should be to confidently communicate your game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics to your player, and trust that the player will be able to keep up. There&amp;rsquo;s a delicate balance here, though &amp;ndash; say too little, and your player won&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable contributing to the conversation on their own.</description>

      <description>Welcome.&#xA;This is my new blog, hosted on Github Pages and running on Hugo (after much fighting with inscrutable software dev nerd shit). It&amp;rsquo;s here because I got sick of Wordpress being clunky and locking useful quality of life features behind a paywall. Hopefully this way you won&amp;rsquo;t need uBlock Origin so much.&#xA;For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, the old blog is not being deleted, just deprecated &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping all of my old writings there for archival purposes.</description>

      <description>Orin (aka Sleepmode)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m an Australian video game enthusiast with a particular love of fighting games and arcade-style tests of skill. This place is usually where you can find me writing about that, and sometimes other things. Older writings can be found on my Wordpress Blog, which is no longer in use because I hate QOL features being locked behind a paywall.&#xA;Links to my Twitter, Twitch and Youtube channels can all be found in the sidebar, as well as on my links page.</description>
